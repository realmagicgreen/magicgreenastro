In the last few years that South East Asia in general, and Bali in particular, is in the news for its ocean and land plastic pollution levels.\n\n![Indonesian contemporary artist Handiwirman Saputra has taken on the responsibility to raise the plastic bag problem.

Only bamboo, paper and natural products will be allowed, he told the press.\n\n![Use this bag again and again](./bali-plastic-bags-ban-04.jpg)\n\nIn Australia a similar ban has prevented an estimated 1.5 billion bags being dumped into the environment according to The Guardian UK in December 2018.\n\nColes and Woolworths’ decided to stop offering single-use disposable plastic bags midway through the year and three months on the change has translated to an 80% drop in the consumption of plastic bags nationwide, according to the National Retail Association.\n\n![the Pepito/Popular supermarket chain has already adopted an 100% biodegradable plastic bag](./bali-plastic-bags-ban-05.jpg)\n\nA recent report in Reuters claims that between 500 billion and 1 trillion plastic bags are used annually around the world.

Studies by scientists at NASA, Pennsylvania State University, the University of Georgia and other respected institutions suggest that it can.\n\nPlants are notoriously adept at absorbing gases through pores on the surface of their leaves. It's this skill that facilitates photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy and carbon dioxide into chemical energy to fuel growth.\n\nBut scientists studying the air-purification capacities of indoor plants have found that plants can absorb many other gases in addition to carbon dioxide, including a long list of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Benzene (found in some plastics, fabrics, pesticides and cigarette smoke) and formaldehyde (found in some cosmetics, dish detergent, fabric softener and carpet cleaner) are examples of common indoor VOCs that plants help eliminate.\n\nThese VOCs and other indoor air pollutants (such as ozone) have been linked to numerous acute conditions, including asthma and nausea, as well as chronic diseases such as cancer and respiratory illnesses.\n\nAn indoor plant's ability to remove these harmful compounds from the air is an example of [phytoremediation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoremediation), which is the use of any plant — indoors or out — to mitigate pollution in air, soil or water.\n\nIndoor plants remove pollutants from the air by absorbing these gases through their leaves and roots. The microorganisms that live in the soil of potted plants also play an instrumental role in neutralizing VOCs and other pollutants.\n\nWhile most leafy plants are adept at purifying indoor air, some of the plants that scientists have found most useful in removing VOCs include Japanese royal ferns, spider plants, Boston ferns, purple waffle plants, English ivy, Areca palms, golden pothos, aloe vera, snake plants and peace lilies.\n\n### Areca palm\n\nIn NASA's famous research looking at the air-purifying qualities of houseplants, they found that the areca palm filters certain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the air.\n\n![Areca palm](./02.jpg)\n\nMeanwhile, famed plant scientist Dr. B. C. Wolverton notes that a ~6-foot Areca palm can transpire 1 liter of water per 24 hours, thereby making it an effective humidifier, which can help with allergies, colds, or other breathing discomforts that can disrupt sleep.\n\n### Aloe Vera\n\nEasy to keep and aesthetically pleasing in any home, the aloe vera plant has been named as one of the best plants for air purification by [NASA Clean Air Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Clean_Air_Study).\n\n![Aloe Vera](./05.jpg)\n\nIt releases oxygen at the night, making it an ideal bedroom addition. It also fights benzene, which is found in detergents and plastics, and formaldehyde, found in varnishes and floor finishes, so helps improving the air quality.\n\n### Mother-in-law's tongue\n\nSnake plants are actually an amazing addition to your bedroom. The plant can filter harmful toxins from the air you breathe, remove carbon dioxide from the air, and release oxygen all night long, helping you sleep better and wake up feeling energized.\n\n![Mother-in-law's tongue, also called Snake plant](./06.jpg)\n\nSnake plants are especially recommended for those with allergies and breathing issues such as asthma. Mother-in-law's tongue was shown to be a great air purifier. Researcher [Kamal Meattle gives a TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/kamal_meattle_on_how_to_grow_your_own_fresh_air#t-73315) shout-out to this one too as one of the three plants he uses \"to grow fresh air.\"\n\n### Peepal tree\n\nDespite the negative superstitions, Peepal tree, or Sacred fig, has several benefits which makes it a rather important tree. It not only emits oxygen but can also be used to manage diabetes, treat constipation and asthama.\n\n![Peepal tree](./04.jpg)\n\nThis sacred tree native to the Indian subcontinent hold a wealth of medicinal value and is used to treat many ailments and diseases, ranging from a snake bite to asthma, skin diseases, kidney diseases, constipation, dysentery, impotency and various blood-related problems, said Acharya Bal Krishan of the Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd. in Haridwar, Uttarakhand.\n\n### Orchids\n\nBeautiful and beneficial, orchids are a perfect choice to be settled in the corner of your bedroom. Apart from emitting oxygen during the nighttime, Orchids also banish xylene – pollutant found in paints, and fills the room with fresh air to breathe.\n\n![Orchids](./07.jpg)\n\nWhen photosynthesis stops most plants switch things up and begin absorbing oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. However, orchids, succulents and bromeliads go rebellious and take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen during the p.m. hours, making them great plants to keep the air fresh at night.\n\n### Spider Plant\n\nNot to be confused with the Snake Plant, the Spider Plant is also a champion cleanser of air. [Chlorophytum comosum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophytum_comosum), often called spider plant but also known as airplane plant, St. Bernard's lily, spider ivy, ribbon plant, and hen and chickens is a species of perennial flowering plant. The NASA tests showed it to remove around 90% of the potentially cancer-causing chemical formaldehyde from the air.\n\n![Spider Plant](./08.jpg)\n\nSince formaldehyde is found in common household products like adhesives, grout and fillers, it’s a good idea to keep one of these plants around. Spider Plants will also absorb odors and fumes as well as sustaining oxygen levels in the room, promoting better sleep.\n\n### Lavender\n\nWho doesn’t love the scent of lavender? It’s also probably the most well-known of all plants when it comes to inducing sleep and [reducing anxiety levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612440/).\n\n![Lavender](./09.jpg)\n\nResearch backs up these claims, with lavender scents shown to slow down heart rate, lower blood pressure and levels of stress.\n\nRead more on the [benefits of lavender oil here!](https://bettermindbodysoul.com/benefits-of-lavender-oil/)\n\n### Gardenia\n\nWith glossy evergreen leaves and beautifully scented blossoms, Gardenias are a popular plant choice for bedrooms.\n\n![Gardenia](./10.jpg)\n\nStudies [indicate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20537515) that keeping one in your room may help you achieve a better quality of sleep, with claims that it may be [as effective as Valium](http://aktuell.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/pm2010/pm00222.html.en) in relieving anxiety and promoting sleep.\n\n### English Ivy\n\nHedera helix, the common ivy, English ivy, European ivy, or just ivy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae, native to most of Europe and western Asia. Another one of NASA’s top plants for purifying the air. Studies have shown that English Ivy leaf can improve symptoms of allergies or asthma. The American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology reported that, in a 2005 experiment, English Ivy removed 94% of airborne feces and 78% of airborne mold in just 12 hours!\n\n![English Ivy](./00.jpg)\n\nAs mold can affect our breathing, it’s definitely a plant to have on hand for a great night’s sleep.\n\n### Jasmine\n\nJasmine plants, with its sweet fragrance and gorgeous white flowers, make for an excellent addition to any bedroom.\n\n![Jasmine](./12.jpg)\n\nIt's highly recommended for help with depression, stress, fatigue, and anxiety. Jasmine can lift your mood, calm you down, alleviate stress, and gently lull you to sleep. Studies have shown that subjects who inhaled the scent of jasmine while sleeping experienced deeper sleep, less movement throughout the night, and overall better quality of sleep.\n\n### Rosemary\n\nA commonly used herb for cooking purposes, rosemary can also help you get better sleep. Rosemary has been considered a memory booster for centuries in ancient medicine.\n\n![Rosemary](./13.jpg)\n\nPractitioners today recommend rosemary essential oil for supporting the nervous system and circulatory health, improving concentration, and relieving stress.\n\n## Know More Links\n\n[NASA Clean Air Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Clean_Air_Study)\n\n[(Excellent guide) Air Cleaning Plants - Ohsospotless](https://ohsospotless.com/air-cleaning-plants/)\n\n[Plants to help you sleep](http://www.naturallivingideas.com/12-plants-for-your-bedroom-to-help-you-sleep)\n\n[Indoor plants which clean the air](https://www.livescience.com/38445-indoor-plants-clean-air.html)\n\n[Crassulacean Acid Metabolism, CAM photosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crassulacean_acid_metabolism)\n\n[Houseplants that clean air](https://greatist.com/connect/houseplants-that-clean-air)\n\n[Benefits of lavender oil](https://bettermindbodysoul.com/benefits-of-lavender-oil/)","src/content/posts/bedroom-plants/index.md",[583,584,585,586,587,588,589,590,22,591,592],"./02.jpg","./05.jpg","./06.jpg","./04.jpg","./07.jpg","./08.jpg","./09.jpg","./10.jpg","./12.jpg","./13.jpg","5c9c2b706a01a5cf",{"html":595,"metadata":596},"\u003Cp>Sure, that potted fern is pretty, but can it really spruce up the air quality in your home?

It has a long term duration in between applications of about 6 months.\n\n## The \"Coral Reef\" project.\n\nThe idea for _\"Coral Reef\"_ was born of one of Khan’s ongoing projects in the UAE, the new Museum of Manuscripts in Sharjah.\n\nCurrently under construction, the structure, due in 2021, present a surface made of many small stone elements, referencing traditional local coral-stone buildings and the geometry of _Arish_, the region’s palm-leaf architecture.\n\n> \"When we started working with BioMason, I wondered if we could recreate an element of our building from its biocement, and I wanted that product to use Sharjah’s sand as its a regate material, a resource that is plentiful...\"\n\nsays Khan.\n\n> \"It’s an experiment, but the idea of making a structure from what we found on site is very simple and poetic. We decided to create a prototype section of external wall as our Re-Made project to test this possibility.\"\n\nCreating the structure with Sharjah sand is not straightforward, even with BioMason’s strong, existing ties with this part of the world.\n\n> \"We first used the sands and indigenous a regates in Sharjah in 2009 when we created the technology,\"\n\nsays Krieg Dosier.\n\n> \"We will seek to bring this technology full circle by using Sharjah a regates to produce our BioLith tile product, the company’s main product for commercial and residential applications, as a building façade material.\"\n\nThe collaborator team agrees that more research and strength tests will be needed to ensure the end product’s workability.\n\n> \"BioMason’s process enables materials to be formed in ambient temperatures by replacing the curing process with the formation of biologically controlled structural cement.\"\n\nFor Re-Made, the team is trying to reimagine an element from the museum’s structure as a shelving unit built of biocement.\n\n> \"Fish use coral reefs as places to graze and explore. I think a shelving system can have a similar feeling for people.\"\n\nThe piece may even become part of the museum, when it opens.\n\nBut the point of this project goes beyond its practical applications.\n\nThere’s a deep, conceptual and symbolic value to the experiment.\n\n> \"BioMason was founded by two architects who worked in the UAE from 2007 to 2014.\"\n\nIllustrates Krieg Dosier.\n\n> \"The Re-Made project continues that narrative, expressing regionalism and reverence to other building materials used in the UAE. This project, design and collaboration are a proud and compassionate statement to working with materials found on site and our responsibility to place and environment.\"\n\nKhan feels _\"Coral Reef\"_ is an exciting challenge:\n\n> \"I like that this project gave me the opportunity of remaking something that was precious to us the museum’s original design]. Perhaps we should all challenge our design assumptions more often.\"\n\n## Know More Links\n\n[Biomason - website](https://www.biomason.com)\n\n[Handbook of Bioplastics and Biocomposites Engineering Applications](https://amzn.to/3hN44mG)\n\n[Growing bricks, not another brick in the wall - TEDxWWF](https://youtu.be/OcZl2rRoccU)\n\n[Growing bricks with bacteria - bioMASON- Youtube](https://youtu.be/6BqoM4am8kw)\n\n[Biomason - IG](https://www.instagram.com/biomason)\n\n[Biomason - Twitter](https://twitter.com/biomason)\n\n[Bricks grown from bacteria - archdaily](https://www.archdaily.com/472905/bricks-grown-from-bacteria)\n\n[Bioplastics - An alternative for sustainable living](https://advancebioplast.com/)\n\n[Production of Biodegradable Plastics and Bioplastics Technology](https://amzn.to/2RyvVwx)\n\n[Sustainable Economic Development (World Sustainability Series)](https://amzn.to/3hPYsbA)\n\n[Advances in Carbon Capture: Methods, Technologies and Applications](https://amzn.to/2SpoJCD)","src/content/posts/bio-cement/index.md",[723,724,725,726,727,728,729,730,731],"./bio-cement-02.jpg","./bio-cement-03.jpg","./bio-cement-04.jpg","./bio-cement-07.jpg","./bio-cement-10.jpg","./bio-cement-05.jpg","./bio-cement-08.jpg","./bio-cement-06.jpg","./bio-cement.jpg","f5c2d765c1941b0c",{"html":734,"metadata":735},"\u003Cdiv class=\"toc\">\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#we-grow-biocement-no-kiln-firing-no-co2-emissions\">We grow biocement.\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#grown-sustainable-building-material\">Grown sustainable building material.\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#how-its-made\">How it’s made.\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#dust-control-solution\">Dust control solution\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#the-coral-reef-project\">The “Coral Reef” project.\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#know-more-links\">Know More Links\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"tldr\">\n\u003Ch2 id=\"tldr\">TLDR\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Growing biologically controlled calcium carbonate cement by employing microorganisms.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>99% less carbon footprint compared to cement.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Formed at ambient temperatures without dust release.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>As an architect or designer, what is your role in the building industry?

[Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_MIYAWAKI)\n\nUsing the concept of potential natural vegetation, MIYAWAKI developed, tested, and refined a method of ecological engineering today known as the MIYAWAKI method to restore native forests from seeds of native trees on very degraded soils that were deforested and without humus.\n\nWith the results of his experiments, he restored protective forests in over 1,300 sites in Japan and various tropical countries, in particular in the Pacific region in the form of SHELTERBELTS, woodlands, and WOODLOTS, including urban, port, and industrial areas.\n\n![Sasayama1](./sasayama.jpg)\n\nMIYAWAKI demonstrated that rapid restoration of forest cover and soil was possible by using a selection of pioneer and secondary indigenous species that were densely planted and provided with mycorrhiza.\n\nMIYAWAKI observed trees that traditionally grew around temples, shrines, and cemeteries in Japan, such as the Japanese blue oak, CASTANOPSIS CUSPIDATA, bamboo-leaf oak, Japanese chestnut trees, and MACHILUS THUNBERGII. He believed that they were relicts of the primary forest.\n\nMeanwhile, he noted that trees such as Japanese cedar, cypress and larch pine, supposedly native to Japan, had been introduced into Japan over centuries by foresters to produce timber.\n\nMIYAWAKI reflected on the consequences of the change in composition and structure of most Japanese forests, most of which do not contain solely their original natural vegetation.\n\nHe calculated that only 0.06% of contemporary Japanese forests were indigenous forests.\n\nRead [Plant ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_ecology)\n\n## MIYAWAKI method\n\nHis method was deemed exemplary in a preparatory report for the 1992 Earth Summit, and in 1994 in the biodiversity congress of the UNESCO in Paris.\n\nThe method was also presented in 1991 at the Symposium of the University of Bonn, and at the congresses of the International Association for Ecology, the International Society for Vegetation Science, and the International Botanical Congress, which included new aspects such as the links between growth, natural habitat, and estimated carbon fixation.\n\n## Conditions for success\n\n_The method's reconstitution of \"indigenous forests by indigenous trees\" produces rich, dense and efficient protective pioneer forests in 20 to 30 years, where natural succession would need 200 years in temperate Japan and 300 to 500 years in the tropics. Success phases_:\n\n- RIGOROUS INITIAL SITE SURVEY\n\n  Survey and research of potential natural vegetation.\n\n  Identification and collection of a large number of various native seeds, locally or nearby and in a comparable geo-climatic context.\n\n- GERMINATION IN A NURSERY\n\n  Which requires additional maintenance for some species; for example, those that germinate only after passing through the digestive tract of a certain animal, need a particular symbiotic fungus, or a cold induced dorming phase.\n\n\n- PREPARATION OF THE SUBSTRATE\n\n  If it is very degraded, such as the addition of organic matter or mulch, and, in areas with heavy or torrential rainfall, planting mounds for taproot species that require a well-drained soil surface.\n\n  Hill slopes can be planted with more ubiquitous surface roots species, such as cedar, Japanese cypress, and pine.\n\n\n- PLANTATIONS RESPECTING BIODIVERSITY\n\n  Inspired by the model of the natural forest. A dense plantation of very young seedlings (but with an already mature root system: with symbiotic bacteria and fungi present) is recommended.\n\n  Density aims at stirring competition between species and the onset of phytosociological relations close to what would happen in nature (three to five plants per square metre in the temperate zone, up to five or ten seedlings per square metre in Borneo).\n\n\n- PLANTATIONS RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED IN SPACE\n\n  In the way plants are distributed in a clearing or at the edge of the natural forest, not in rows or staggered\n\n![SO MUCH BIO MASS PRODUCING OXYGEN!](./biogradska_suma.jpg)\n\n## Biocoenosis\n\nA biocenosis, coined by Karl Möbius in 1877, describes the interacting organisms living together in a habitat (biotope).[Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_M%C3%B6bius)\n\nThe use of this term has declined in the 21st сentury.\n\nIn the palaeontological literature, the term distinguishes \"LIFE ASSEMBLAGES\", which reflect the original living community, living together at one place and time.\n\nIn other words, it is an assemblage of fossils or a community of specific time, which is different from \"DEATH ASSEMBLAGES\" (thanatocoenoses).\n\nNo palaeontological assemblage will ever completely represent the original biological community (i.e. the biocoenosis, in the sense used by an ecologist); the term thus has somewhat different meanings in a palaeontological and an ecological context.\n\n**Based on the concept of biocenosis, ecological communities can take various forms:**\n\n- Zoocenosis for the faunal community,\n- Phytocenosis for the flora community,\n- Microbiocenosis for the microbial community.\n\nThe geographical extent of a biocenose is limited by the requirement of a more or less uniform species composition.\n\n## Know More Links\n\n[Biocoenosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocoenosis)","src/content/posts/biocoenosis-natural-forests/index.md",[780,781,782],"./sasayama.jpg","./biogradska_suma.jpg","./diego_garcia_mixed_species_marsh.jpg","7c8281df11de2aa1",{"html":785,"metadata":786},"\u003Cdiv class=\"toc\">\n\u003C!-- TOC -->\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#tldr\">TLDR\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#akira-miyawaki\">Akira MIYAWAKI\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#miyawaki-method\">MIYAWAKI method\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#conditions-for-success\">Conditions for success\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#biocoenosis\">Biocoenosis\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#know-more-links\">Know More Links\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C!-- /TOC -->\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"tldr\">\n\u003Ch2 id=\"tldr\">TLDR\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>MIYAWAKI advocated for the restoration of natural forests\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>His method was deemed exemplary in a preparatory report for the 1992 Earth Summit, and in 1994 in the biodiversity congress of the UNESCO in Paris.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Focusing on potential natural vegetation, MIYAWAKI developed, tested, and refined a method of ecological engineering, the MIYAWAKI method, to restore native forests from seeds of native trees on very degraded soils that were deforested and without humus.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"akira-miyawaki\">Akira MIYAWAKI\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Beginning in the 1970s, MIYAWAKI advocated for the restoration of natural forests.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In 1992, he said he believed that the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro failed to emphasize the protection of native forests, most of which continued to decline. \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_MIYAWAKI\">Read more\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Using the concept of potential natural vegetation, MIYAWAKI developed, tested, and refined a method of ecological engineering today known as the MIYAWAKI method to restore native forests from seeds of native trees on very degraded soils that were deforested and without humus.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With the results of his experiments, he restored protective forests in over 1,300 sites in Japan and various tropical countries, in particular in the Pacific region in the form of SHELTERBELTS, woodlands, and WOODLOTS, including urban, port, and industrial areas.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./sasayama.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Sasayama1&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>MIYAWAKI demonstrated that rapid restoration of forest cover and soil was possible by using a selection of pioneer and secondary indigenous species that were densely planted and provided with mycorrhiza.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>MIYAWAKI observed trees that traditionally grew around temples, shrines, and cemeteries in Japan, such as the Japanese blue oak, CASTANOPSIS CUSPIDATA, bamboo-leaf oak, Japanese chestnut trees, and MACHILUS THUNBERGII.

They calculated a possible lifetime of more than 20 years.\n\nTheir brick are reusable, recyclable and can be remanufactured, so generating a production close to a circular economy loop.\n\nTransforming plastic waste into recycled building materials they provide a solution to Indonesia’s plastic waste problem.\n\n\u003C/div>\n\n\n\n## REBRICKS MISSION\n\nOvy Sabrina and Novita Tan, Rebricks founders, where very concerned for the environment. Indonesia is one of the most polluted country in the world.\n\nWith little to no pullution management education, no istitutional rubbish collection, widespread trash burning across the archipelago, no sewage system and big poplutaion density, the resulting damage to the ecosystem has reached unsustainable levels here.\n\n![20% of Rebricks paving block is rejected plastic waste.](./rebricks-01.jpg)\n\nThere are some bottle reclycling facilities, called 'Bank Sampah' litteraly 'rubbish bank', where poor people sell bottles collected by walking their neighborhood, but many types of plastic waste cannot be recycled.\n\nThis unrecyclable plastic, sachets, plastic bags, bubble wrap and other packaging, has no price and is ignored by collectors. So it ends in the sea and landfill.\n\nRebricks estensively tested possible techniques, leveragin Ovy's experience in the field of building materials and developed a formula and methods to produce long lasting building material that can be used in everyday building contructions.\n\n## PAVING BLOCK\n\nPaving blocks, the first Rebricks product, have been tested at [B4T](https://www.b4t.go.id/)(Great Hall of Material and Technical Goods) where they meet the SNI class B criteria, suitable for use as parking lots for pedestrians and parks.\n\n\n![Paving blocks, the first Rebricks product.](./rebricks-02.jpg)\n\nFrom each Rebricks paving block, almost 20% is rejected plastic waste.\n\n## HOLLOW BLOCKS AND ROOF TILES\n\n\n![Rosters are aventilation brick used in hot climates.](./rebricks-03.jpg)\n\nRebrick now offers a variety of products, including hollow blocks and rosters where the absorption of plastic waste is even greater.\n\n\n\n![Rosters are aventilation brick used in hot climates.](./rebricks-04.jpg)\n\nTheir products are able to compete in price and strength with other conventional building materials.\n\n## THE ACTUAL MAKING AVOIDS POLLUTION\n\nThe actual making avoids pollution and does not generate new waste in the production process.\n\nRebricks' production capacity is currently 100 m2/day, recycling 88,000 sachets of plastic waste, about 25 kilograms of waste plastic. They are active in Jakarta, an other places in Java, Sulawesi, Bali and Sumatra.\n\n\n## MOTIVATION: DO SOMETHING GOOD FOR THE PLANET\n\nRebricks intend to do good for the Planet. Reduce the high level of plastic waste Indonesian society produces.\n\nWhen the Rebricks business started had no clear idea on how to go about collecting this rejected plastic waste supply.\n\nSo they started a campaign to mobilize the community and the response that was obtained was extraordinary.\n\nThere are many stories of changing behavior in sorting waste because of the Rebricks movement, people are becoming more aware of the impact of disposing of this type of plastic waste.\n\nEven though few people are today aware and willing to do the simplest thing to help, their succes is growing.\n\nMore people are bringing a shopping bag or carrying a stainless straw from home.\n\nThese small actions are the easiest to do so they represent a good starting point in caring about the environment and can have a big impact.\n\n## SPREADING AWARENESS\n\nOf paramount importance tackling the enviroments pollutions is education and spreading awareness. So Rebricks is focused also in building collaborations. As you can [read on their website](https://rebricks.id/what-we-do/habitat-for-humanity-collaboration-with-rebricks-to-launch-climate-smart-housing-2023) their work with several institutions.\n\nOther collaborative projects have been started withg WWF Indonesia, Nutrifood, Hush Puppies, Novo Nordisk and several national institutions.\n\nHokBen, a fast food restaurant chain serving Japanese-style food based in Jakarta is working with Rebricks to process its food packaging waste made from polystyrene into something useful and valuable, namely roster.\n\nRoster is a wall component that functions as a vent that helps air circulation. Usually roster is made of clay, adobe and concrete.\n\nHokBen and Rebricks made a roster using HokBen food packaging.\n\nRebricks and Novo Nordisk started the Circular for Zero program in 2021, a webinar on how to choose waste, explaining what rejected waste is and where to send it to Novo Nordisk employees.\n\nParticipants managed to collect 125 kg or 125,000 disposable plastic packaging waste needed for the construction of 2 bathrooms and 2 toilets in Kampung Pemulung.\n\n## CLIMATE SMART HOUSING\n\nHabitat for Humanity in collaboration with Rebricks launched in 2023 'Climate Smart Housing'.\n\nThe amount of waste that currently produced by household if not treated properly brings a lot of disaster, as is evident to anyone who ahs visted Indonesia, and noticed that all kinds of trash is everywhere, not only in city streets but also in jungles and beaches.\n\nHabitat for Humanity Indonesia is working with Rebricks Indonesia to build Climate Smart Housing, in order to create a greener circular economy.\n\nRebricks buys rejected waste from the Habitat fostered community in Mauk, Tangerang, Banten.\n\nThis waste is then recycled into raw materials for constructions. Then, Habitat will use the recycled product making houses for the community in Mauk.\n\nAlso through this program, 1 house built is able to avoid 270 kg of rubbish ending up in landfill or sea.\n\n\n## Know More Links\n\n[Rebricks website](https://rebricks.id/)\n\n[Rebricks YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@rebricksindonesia7608)\n\n[Habitat for humanity](https://www.habitat.org/)\n\n[Habitat for humanity - Indonesia](https://www.habitat.org/where-we-build/indonesia)\n\n[Novonordisk](https://www.novonordisk.com/sustainable-business/zero-environmental-impact.html)","src/content/posts/bricks-from-waste/index.md",[905,906,907,908,909],"./rebricks-01.jpg","./rebricks-02.jpg","./rebricks-03.jpg","./rebricks-04.jpg","./rebricks-05.jpg","2b2c00ee5bd31683",{"html":912,"metadata":913},"\u003Cdiv class=\"toc\">\n\u003C!-- TOC -->\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#tldr\">TLDR\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#rebricks-mission\">REBRICKS MISSION\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#paving-block\">PAVING BLOCK\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#hollow-blocks-and-roof-tiles\">HOLLOW BLOCKS AND ROOF TILES\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#the-actual-making-avoids-pollution\">THE ACTUAL MAKING AVOIDS POLLUTION\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#motivation-do-something-good-for-the-planet\">MOTIVATION: DO SOMETHING GOOD FOR THE PLANET\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#spreading-awareness\">SPREADING AWARENESS\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#climate-smart-housing\">CLIMATE SMART HOUSING\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#know-more-links\">Know More Links\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C!-- /TOC -->\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"tldr\">\n\u003Ch2 id=\"tldr\">TLDR\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Indonesia firm REBRICKS turns waste plastic into bricks.

To promote plastic bag free zones, check [One Island One Voice website](https://www.oneislandonevoice.org/).\n\n### River booms\n\nRiver booms collect trash that would otherwise flow into the ocean or get stuck on the coastline.\n\nBBPB works with students from Green School to build booms from recycled material and use in rivers across Bali.\n\n### A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE\n\nWomen from a mountain village in Bali are making alternative bags, using collected and donated cloth materials.\n\nThe bags will be sold across Bali retailers.\n\nFor every one bag sold, one bag will be donated to a local community member.\n\n### Education Booklet\n\nIn 2014, BBPB completed version 1 of their educational booklet for primary aged students to learn about the harms of plastic.\n\n![The plastic problem in numbers](./byebye-plastic-bags-04.jpg)\n\nIt was distributed throughout schools in Indonesia.

What it can do is remarkable. It grows far more quickly than timber and doesn't destroy the land it's grown on\" _Ben Ripple, Big Tree Farms Bali co-founder_\n\nAll over the world buildings utilize bamboo. It is used for skeletons for his strength, for furniture, curtains, accessories or coffee tables made from thin bamboo slats.\n\n\n## Flexibility.\n\nFlexibility has helped bamboo being used in flooring, staircase railings, balustrades and slanted windows in houses.\n\nSome of the State Bamboo Corporations in India have launched interlocking floor tiles made of flattened bamboo boards, with technology sourced from China.[2]\n\nRecent innovative bamboo flooring resembles smooth timber.\n\n## Fast Growing!\n\nOne reason bamboo is so environmentally-friendly is the speed at which it grows. It provides excellent erosion control because of its extensive interlocking rhizomes or root systems, helps in bio-remediation of both soil and water. [1]\n\nStudies show construction is one of the world's least sustainable industries, eating up around half of the globe's non-renewable resources, but sustainable construction is slowly taking root around the world.\n\n> \"In China, eucalyptus can grow at three to four meters a year, which is very impressive for timber. But building-quality bamboo will grow between six and 10 meters in that time,\"_Terry Sunderland, scientist at the Centre for International Forestry Research in Indonesia_\n\n![Madrid Barajas Airport](./building-with-bamboo-04.jpg)\n\n### Bamboo drawbacks.\n\nWithout intensive treatment, it is prone to rotting and catches fire relatively easily, which is why many countries limit bamboo structures height by law.\n\nBamboo possesses large amounts of starch (sugars) which are the principle nutrients for parasites, borers and fungi.\n\nWhen carbohydrates are reduced, the bamboo culm will be more naturally resistant to those biological degrading organisms. [3]\n\nStarch content is at its highest level at the end of dry season, the plant is acquiring and conserving nutrients for shoot growth in the next rainy season.\n\nDuring rainy season, starch content is lower, since new shoots are consuming all the nutrients, but moisture content in the bamboo culms is high.\n\nRecommended time to harvest bamboo is at the end of rainy season - beginning of the dry season. [3]\n\n## Harvesting time.\n\nStudies show remarkable differences with untreated bamboo, when harvested at specific hours and moon.\n\nThe starch content is lowest when the moon is closer to earth, providing higher gravitation.\n\nNote that due to the moon elliptic orbit, gravitation is not related to the moon phase, as popular beliefs suggest. [3]\n\nBamboo is harvested before sunrise, when most of the starch is still in the roots. To further reduce starch sometimes bamboo is also soaked for 90 days before further treatments.\n\n![Bamboo Forest in Japan](./building-with-bamboo-02.jpg)\n\nOnly mature bamboo, between 4 and 7 years old, is harvested. Poles inside the clump are older than those growing outside.\n\nAn experienced bamboo harvester will be able to tell the age of bamboo by knocking on the culm and listening the different sounds. [3]\n\n## Treatement is improving.\n\nBuilding with bamboo is not fool proof, but technologies to protect it from the elements are rapidly improving.\n\nHight heat is used to cure the bamboo. The bamboo will change color slightly. Resin will rise to the surface, making it stronger.\n\nResin is rubbed into the bamboo culms. The color will slowly change from deep green to mint green. [4]\n\nHoles are then poked in its inner membranes to quicken the drying process. The culms are stored away from direct soil to prevent fungal or insect infestations and away from direct sunlight, as moisture will damage it. [4]\n\nBamboo is then covered with a tarp and provided decent air ventilation. Vertical stacking lessens the chance of a fungal infection. But sturdier support system is needed to prevent bending. [4]\n\nHorizontal stacking works better for large stacks. A thick, plastic sheet is placed under each stacks prevent fungal infections.\n\nPoles are rotated every 15 days. This assures culms will dry in a uniform fashion. Bamboo should be dry in 6 to 12 weeks. [5]\n\nWhen it loses its glossy appearance its restored by gently oiling and waxing the bamboo once the drying process is finished. [6]\n\nTo remove bamboo mold, lemon oil or a solution of vinegar and water can be used. Bamboo furniture usually 3 coats of polyurethane is applied to ensure the conservation of the furniture after treating it with turpentine and dried out completely. [6]\n\n## References\n\n1.

To understand the source of plastic pollution in our rivers, they then take a sample from each material category every month to identify the manufacturing brand.\n\n![Common sight in Bali Indonesia](./02.jpg)\n\n\nBy doing this, they can identify the companies that are most responsible.\n\n>\"In 2021, we audited 214,732 single waste items. In 2022, our brand audit analyzed a total of 235,218 single waste items.\n\nThis revealed the top 10 parent companies responsible for plastic pollution in Indonesia, with 26% of the waste items being unidentified...\"\n\nBy sorting through the 535,246 kg of non-organic waste collected, they were able to identify the type of materials that are polluting our rivers, which has enabled us to further process each waste stream for recycling or up-cycling.\n\nFrom the 11 categories listed here, they are able to recycle 51% of what they collected in 2022.\n\n\n![Common sight in Bali Indonesia](./04.jpg)\n\nThis includes colored plastic bags, transparent film, glass, PET bottles, hard plastics, and cups.\n\nThey are actively working towards finding solutions for the other waste streams such as sachets, sandals, fabrics, and styrofoam.\n\nThe most common type of waste they found in 2022 was residual waste (29%), which is anything that has been damaged beyond repair and can no longer be recycled after being in open environments for years.\n\nThe categories that fall under residual waste include burnt plastic, diapers, sanitary waste, cables and tanglers, face masks, banners made from poly, very dirty or deteriorated HDPE/PET, mesh, vinyl, pillows and synthetic fabrics, fishing nets, fishing lines and large pieces of styrofoam that are too dirty to be recycled.\n\nthey collect most of these residual items from our illegal landfill cleanups and our mangrove cleanups.\n\nAlthough they are working towards finding a better solution to properly disposing of this category, the only current viable solution in Indonesia is to send this category to government managed landfills.\n\nThrough this waste audit, they are reminded that there is still a lot of work left to be done to avoid this waste from leaking into the environment.\n\n\nThey hope that this data can further emphasize the need for proper waste management practices, increased recycling initiatives, and most importantly a reduction in the use of single-use plastic.\n\n## VILLAGE MODEL NEW APPROACH\n\nAt Sungai Watch, they believe the easiest way to solve plastic pollution from going into the ocean is by starting in our rivers, where they can directly stop the flow of plastics.\n\nThe solution: to install simple trash barriers in rivers and work upstream in preventing this plastic from entering the rivers.\n\n\n![Install simple trash barriers](./03.jpg)\n\nOver the course of 2022, they continued installing more barriers and adapting our barrier designs to fit new river environments.\n\n\nNo two rivers are the same and they therefore take every barrier installation with a new approach. Our barriers are effective, however, no matter how many barriers they install, plastic is still entering our rivers at devastating speeds with illegal dumping happening along riverbanks.\n\nThey therefore mapped as many illegal landfills and dumps as they could to track the movement  of plastic pollution and understand where and how it enters our rivers.\n\n\nOnce they identify a trash hot spot, they launch a cleanup and awareness campaign to stop dumping within that community.\n\nIn 2022, they organized 429 cleanups in illegal landfills along riverbanks and worked with local communities to find better waste management practices to ensure dumping no longer occurs along rivers.\n\n\nThey therefore switched approach to not only focus 100% of efforts on installing barriers, but instead working upstream on cleaning illegal landfills, educating local communities, and finding a more wholesome system to tackle the roots of plastic pollution ending up in our rivers.\n\n## CLEANUPS\n\nOn the island of Bali, it is predicted that only 4% of plastics are recycled.\n\nA lot of this is due to the lack of waste management and recycling infrastructure.\n\nAlthough Indonesia has pledged to reduce 70% of plastic pollution it emits into the ocean by 2025, Sungai watch are continuing to see an increase in illegal landfills that are piling up alongside rivers.\n\n[Get

The Romans’ innovative use of lime, particularly through ‘hot mixing’ techniques, endowed their concrete with self-healing properties. This approach allowed their structures to endure for over 2,000 years, as the lime would expand and seal micro-cracks upon exposure to water, effectively enabling the concrete to repair itself over time.\n\n  \n\n## Here’s how, step by step\n\n**Step 1: Prepare the lime-wash CALCE\n\nlime-wash is breathable, natural, and ideal for your purpose since it whitens the walls and acts as a binder.\n\n  \n\n## **Materials Needed:**\n\n• **Hydrated Lime (Calcium Hydroxide)**: Available at building or masonry supply stores.\n\n• **Water**: For diluting the lime.\n\n• **Natural Pigments (Optional)**: If you want to tint the lime-wash.\n\n• **Bucket**: For mixing.\n\n• **Paintbrush or Roller**: For application.\n\n  \n\n## **Preparation:**\n\n1. In a bucket, mix **1 part hydrated lime** with **3 parts water** (by volume).\n\n2. Stir thoroughly to ensure a smooth, creamy consistency.\n\n3. Let the mixture sit for at least 12 hours to “mature.” This improves adhesion and reduces dusting later.\n\n4. Optionally, add natural pigments to tint the mixture and stir again.\n\n  \n\n**Step 2: Apply the lime-wash**\n\n  \n\nlime-wash will create a natural white coating, ideal for an old house’s walls.\n\n  \n\n**Application:**\n\n1. **Dampen the Walls:** Lightly mist the wall with water using a spray bottle. This helps the lime-wash adhere and prevents it from drying too quickly.\n\n2. **Apply the First Coat:** Use a wide paintbrush or roller to apply a thin layer of lime-wash. Avoid thick coats as they can crack.\n\n3. **Drying Time:** Allow the first coat to dry fully (12-24 hours).\n\n4. **Second Coat (Optional):** Apply a second or third coat if needed, allowing each to dry in between.\n\n  \n\n**Step 3: Seal with Duraseal Zero**\n\n  \n\nOnce the lime-wash has cured completely (several days to a week), you can seal it with **Duraseal Zero** to lock in the lime, preventing dust and ensuring a durable finish.\n\n  \n\n### **Sealing Process:**\n\n1. Ensure the lime-washed walls are completely dry and stable.\n\n2. Stir the **Duraseal Zero** thoroughly before use.\n\n3. Using a paintbrush or roller, apply a thin, even layer of the sealer.\n\n4. Allow it to dry per the manufacturer’s instructions (usually a few hours).\n\n5. Apply a second coat if needed for added protection.\n\n  \n\n**Benefits of This Method**\n\n1. **Natural and Breathable:** Lime-wash and Duraseal Zero both allow the walls to breathe, preventing moisture buildup.\n\n2. **Dust-Free Finish:** Sealing the lime-wash prevents the common dusting issue of traditional lime coatings.\n\n3. **Eco-Friendly:** Both lime-wash and Duraseal Zero are non-toxic and sustainable.\n\n  \n\nThis combination ensures your walls are white, stabilised, and safe, while maintaining the breathable and aesthetic qualities of lime.\n\n## Know More Links\n\n[Roman Durable Concrete](https://www.designboom.com/architecture/ancient-roman-concrete-durable-mit-self-healing-abilities-01-09-2023/)","src/content/posts/clever-fix-clean-air/index.md",[22],"fb240356592eeb36",{"html":1155,"metadata":1156},"\u003Cp>Yes, approach safety which makes sense!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"tldr\">TLDR\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In Italian, CALCE refers to lime (calcium hydroxide), a crucial component in ancient Roman construction.

In addition, regular coffee consumption can lead to a reduction of nutrients absorption in the intestine, leading to future deficiencies.\n\n### PESTICIDES\n\nCoffee is one of the most heavily PESTICIDED crops. The main exporters of coffee are South American countries, such as Colombia, where pesticides such as [Heptachlor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptachlor), [Chlordane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlordane) and [Dieldrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieldrin) are used. These chemicals are toxins to our bodies.\n\n### LIVER OVERWORK\n\nDRINKING COFFEE IN ECCESS can take its toll on the LIVER, the main organ in charge of burning fat and purifying the body.\n\nThe liver can become overloaded trying to clean out all the chemical residues in coffee, along with all the caffeine.\n\nThis prevents our blood from cleansing properly and allowing us to regenerate our tissues healthily.\n\n### SUPRARENAL GLANDS STRESS\n\nAre you one of those people who can't get rid of dark circles under your eyes? This may be related to an overload of your adrenal glands.\n\nCoffee contains an acidic oil which can irritate the stomach especially if empty. Coffee's boost to adrenaline secretion can trigger hypoglycaemia, leading to food cravings, energy ups and downs and mood swings.\n\n[To limit coffee acidity problem drink it with no milk and no sugar.](./02.jpg)\n\n## TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE BALANCE\n\nIn Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), food and its effects on the body is viewed in terms of balancing YIN and YANG, as well as the principles of QI (vital energy) and the body's organ systems.\n\nWhile TCM does not specifically address the acidity of coffee in the same way as modern Western medicine, it does consider the overall effects of food and beverages on the body's internal balance and organ systems.\n\nIn TCM, coffee is considered to have WARMING properties, and its stimulating effects are associated with an increase in yang energy.\n\nExcessive consumption of coffee, like any strongly warming or stimulating substance, can potentially disrupt the body's natural balance.\n\nHere are some ways coffee consumption, including its acidity, can be related to blood health in TCM terms:\n\n### LIVER AND BLOOD\n\nThe liver is closely linked to the health of the blood. The liver is responsible for storing blood and ensuring the smooth flow of QI and blood.\n\nExcessive consumption of coffee's warming and stimulating properties may affect the liver's function, potentially leading to liver QI stagnation or heat in the liver.\n\nIn TCM, this can be associated with symptoms like irritability, headaches, and menstrual irregularities.\n\nHEART AND BLOOD CIRCULATION: The heart plays a vital role in blood circulation. Coffee's may lead to an increase in heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nIn TCM terms, this could be seen as an excess of YANG energy, potentially affecting the heart and blood vessels.\n\n### QI AND BLOOD DEFICIENCY\n\nChronic excessive coffee consumption can lead to imbalances. Excessive YANG can consume YIN and fluids over time. This imbalance could manifest as symptoms such as dryness, fatigue, and even affect menstrual health.\n\nIt's important to remember that TCM views each person as an individual with a unique constitution, and the effects of coffee or any other food or beverage can vary from person to person.\n\nSome individuals may tolerate coffee well, while others may experience more noticeable imbalances.\n\nIf you are concerned about how coffee consumption may be affecting your health from a TCM perspective, it's best to consult with a qualified TCM practitioner who can assess your overall health and provide personalized advice based on TCM principles.\n\nThey may recommend specific dietary adjustments or herbal remedies to support your individual constitution and address any imbalances that may arise from coffee consumption.\n\n\n[Coffee roasted beans and in the backgroud the red ripe beans as the the appear on the plant](./03.jpg)\n\n## HEALTH RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nWhen you decide that coffee benefits are more important than the problems it can bring.\n\nDrink ORGANIC COFFEE, don't pollute your body with all the chemicals used in coffee cultivation.\n\nDECAFFEINATED is NOT better. Its caffeine extracted using a chemical called [trichloroethylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichloroethylene), the same chemical used for dry cleaning and metal degreasing.\n\nIf you like your coffee with milk or sugar, use VEGETABLE MILK SUBSITUTES and sweeteners such as [stevia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevia), coconut nectar or maple syrup. We don't want to further acidify the drink by adding dairy or sugar.\n\nDo not drink more than 1 coffee a day. One cup of coffee won't hurt you.\n\n## SWITCH TO TEAS\n\nBlack tea, [Yerba Mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_mate) or [Matcha Tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matcha) contain similar substances to caffeine or its derivatives but in smaller quantities, and are good substitutes.\n\n\n## ALKALINIZING FOODS\n\n### LEAFY GREENS\n\nLeafy green vegetables like spinach, kale, collard greens, Swiss chard, and arugula are highly alkaline and packed with nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.\n\n### CUCUMBERS\n\nCucumbers have a high water content and are known for their alkalizing properties. They are refreshing and versatile, making them a popular addition to salads and other dishes.\n\n### AVOCADO\n\nAvocado is a nutrient-dense fruit that is not only alkaline but also rich in healthy fats, fiber, vitamins, and minerals.\n\n### BROCCOLI\n\nBroccoli is a cruciferous vegetable that is both alkaline and an excellent source of vitamins C and K, fiber, and various antioxidants.\n\n### BELL PEPPERS\n\nRed, green, and yellow bell peppers are alkaline and provide a good amount of vitamins A and C, along with other beneficial nutrients.\n\nIncluding these alkaline foods in your diet can help promote a balanced pH level in the body and contribute to overall health and well-being.\n\n\n## ACIDIFYING FOODS\n\n### MEAT\n\nAll types of meat, including beef, poultry, pork, and fish, are considered acidifying foods.\n\n### DAIRY PRODUCTS\n\nMost dairy products, such as milk, cheese, yogurt, and butter, have an acidifying effect on the body.\n\n### GRAINS\n\nMany grains, including wheat, rice, oats, and corn, are acid-forming when metabolized in the body.\n\n### PROCESSED FOODS\n\nProcessed and refined foods, including sugary snacks, sodas, and packaged foods, tend to be acidifying due to their high sugar and artificial ingredient content.\n\n### CERTAIN FRUITS\n\nSome fruits, such as cranberries, blueberries, and plums, have an acidifying effect on the body.\n\nWhile these foods are considered acidifying, it's essential to remember that a healthy diet should include a balance of both alkaline and acidifying foods.\n\nThe body has natural buffering systems to maintain pH balance, and overall dietary patterns and lifestyle choices play a more significant role in maintaining health than the individual pH of specific foods.\n\nAs always, moderation and variety are key to a well-rounded and balanced diet.\n\n## Know More Links\n\n[Yerba Mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_mate)\n\n[Matcha Tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matcha)\n\n[Coffee -

Photo by Rocco Marosi](./gardens-by-the-bay-02.jpg)\n\n**ENERGETICS OF THE CONSERVATORIES**\n\nComprising two glass biomes, the Conservatories replicate the cool-dry climate of the Mediterranean and semi-arid sub-tropical regions and the cool-moist climate of the Tropical Montane region.\n\nThey house a diverse collection of plants that are not commonly seen in this part of the world and are of high conservation value.\n\nThe conservatories are a statement in sustainable engineering and apply a suite of cutting-edge technologies for energy-efficient solutions in cooling.\n\nThis suite of technologies can help to achieve at least 30% savings in energy consumption, compared to conventional cooling technologies.\n\n**1 MINIMISING SOLAR HEAT GAIN**\n\nThe two conservatories are fitted with specially selected glass that allows optimal light in for plants, but reduces a substantial amount of heat.\n\nThe roof is fitted with a sensor-operated retractable sails that opens automatically to provide shade to the plants when it gets too hot.\n\n**2 COOLING ONLY THE OCCUPIED ZONES**\n\nThe Conservatories apply the strategy of cooling only the lower levels, thus reducing the volume of air to be cooled.\n\nThis is achieved through thermal stratification – ground cooling by chilled water pipes cast within the floor slabs enabling cool air to settle at the lower occupied zone while the warm air rises and is vented out at high levels.\n\n**3 DE-HUMIDIFYING THE AIR BEFORE COOLING**\n\nTo reduce the amount of energy required in the cooling process, the air in Flower Dome is de-humidified by liquid desiccant (drying agent) before it is cooled.\n\nThis desiccant is recycled using the waste heat from the burning of the biomass.\n\n![Garden by the bay. Photo by Rocco Marosi](./gardens-by-the-bay-03.jpg)\n\n**4 GENERATING ENERGY AND HARNESSING WASTE HEAT**\n\nElectricity is generated on-site to run the chillers that cool the Conservatories. At the same time, waste heat is captured in the process to regenerate the liquid desiccant.\n\nThis co-generation of energy is achieved by the use of a Combined Heat Power (CHP) steam turbine that is fed by horticultural waste from the Gardens and other parks around Singapore. This reduces dependency on the electrical grid.\n\n## COOL-DRY CONSERVATORY - FLOWER DOME\n\nEnter a world of perpetual spring!

Use metal and wooden eating and cooking utensils instead of plastic utensils.\n\n- Find food and water containers that are BPA-free. Avoid **phthalates** by primarily avoiding PVC products (labeled as #3 plastic).\n\n- Look for phthalates-free labels.\n\n- When possible, air new plastic products like blowup mattresses, synthetic-fiber rugs, tablecloths, and toys outside for a few hours to let the VOCs disperse.\n\n- Avoid plastics numbered #6 and #7 whenever possible.\n\n## The plastic types\n\n![Look for BPA-free on the label of products](./food-safe-plastic-02.jpg)\n\n## **1. PET: Poly Ethylene Terephthalate.**\n\nPET or PETE is commonly used in commercially sold drink bottles, and condiment bottles (like ketchup). Generally considered a “safe” plastic, as **does not contain BPA**, in the presence of heat **it can leach antimony, a toxic metalloid**, into food and beverages, which can cause vomiting, diarrhea and stomach ulcers.\n\nSome studies have shown up to **100 times the amount of antimony in bottled water** than in clean groundwater. The longer the bottle is on the shelf or exposed to heat or sunshine, the more antimony is likely to have leached into the product.\n\nAntimony (Sb) is a silver-white brittle solid or a dark-gray, lustrous powder. It can be harmful to the eyes and skin. **Antimony can also cause problems with the lungs, heart, and stomach**. Workers may be harmed from exposure to antimony and its compounds.\n\n## **2. HDPE: High Density Poly Ethylene.**\n\nHDPE is commonly used in milk and juice bottles, detergent bottles, shampoo bottles, grocery bags, and cereal box liners. Like PET, it is also considered “safe,” but has been shown to **leach estrogenic chemicals dangerous to fetuses and juveniles**.\n\n## **3. PVC: Poly Vinyl Chloride.**\n\nPVC can be flexible or rigid, and is used for plumbing pipes, clear food packaging, shrink wrap, plastic children’s toys, tablecloths, vinyl flooring, children’s play mats, and blister packs (such as for medicines).\n\nPVC contains a phthalate called DEHP, which **can cause male traits to become more feminized** (DEHP-containing products have been banned in many countries, but not the U.S.). In some products, DEHP has been replaced with another chemical called DiNP, which has similarly been shown to have **hormone disruption properties**.\n\n## **4. LDPE: Low Density Poly Ethylene.**\n\nLDPE is used for dry cleaning bags, bread bags, newspaper bags, produce bags, and garbage bags, as well as “paper” milk cartons and hot/cold beverage cups. LDPE does not contain BPA, but as with most plastics, **it can leach estrogenic chemicals**.\n\n## **5. PP: Poly Propylene.**\n\n**Poly Propylene is generally considered to be one of the safer plastics.**\nPP is used to make yogurt containers, deli food containers and winter clothing insulation. PP actually has a high heat tolerance and as such, **does not seem to leach many of the chemicals other plastics do**.\n\n## **6. PS: Poly Styrene**\n\nPS, also popularly known as Styrofoam, is used for cups, plates, take-out containers, supermarket meat trays, and packing peanuts. **Polystyrene can leach styrene, a suspected carcinogen, especially in the presence of heat** (which makes hot coffee in a Styrofoam container an unwise choice).\n\n## **7. Everything else.**\n\nAny plastic item not made from the above six plastics is lumped together as a #7 plastic. Any plastic designated #7 is likely to **leach BPA and/or BPS**, both [**potent endocrine disruptors**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32112812/) linked to interfering with proper mood, growth, development, sexual function, reproductive function, and puberty, among other essential human developmental processes. They are also suspected of **increasing the risk of adult reproductive cancers, obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes**.\n\n## Know More Links\n\n[Toxic traps 7 types dangerous plastic](https://www.alternet.org/personal-health/toxic-traps-when-these-7-types-plastic-are-dangerous)\n\n[BPA leached 55 times more rapidly when exposure to heat](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080130092108.htm)\n\n[BPA replacement also alters hormones](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bpa-replacement-also-alters-hormones/)\n\n[95% of urine samples contained some BPA - Centers for Disease Control](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/sya-bpa/)\n\n[Bisphenol A (BPA) an endocrine disruptor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21605673)\n\n[Phthalates in plastic products containing PVC](https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/Phthalates_FactSheet.html)\n\n[Manufacturing of plastic - toxic chemicals released - carcinogenic or neurotoxic](https://ecologycenter.org/plastics/ptf/report3/)\n\n[Bioplastics - An alternative for sustainable living](https://advancebioplast.com/)\n\n[Endocrine Disruptors](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/endocrine/index.cfm)\n\n[Consensus on the key characteristics of endocrine-disrupting chemicals](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-019-0273-8)","src/content/posts/food-safe-plastic/index.md",[1693,1694],"./food-safe-plastic-02.jpg","./food-safe-plastic.jpg","d98e81ce4144dc0c",{"html":1697,"metadata":1698},"\u003Cp>The obvious solution to avoiding plastic toxicity is to avoid plastics, which, in a world awash in plastic, is pretty difficult.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the absence of this, it makes sense to limit your close encounters with plastic as best as you can.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“BPA should be considered a hazard to human development and reproduction with clear evidence of adverse effects.” \u003Cem>Sarah Janssen of the Natural Resources Defense Council\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Look for the symbol.

Anti-inflammatory foods, exercise, good sleep and stress management can help.","Inflammation can occur in response to trauma, illness and stress.\n\nIt can also be caused by unhealthy foods and lifestyle habits.\n\nAnti-inflammatory foods, exercise, good sleep and stress management can help.\n\n### Turmeric and Curcumin\n\n![Curcumin or Turmeric provides several impressive health benefits.](./fight-inflammation-with-food.jpg)\n\n[Curcumin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcumin) is a component of the spice Turmeric. It provides several impressive health benefits.\n\nIt can decrease inflammation in [diabetes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26088351), heart disease, [inflammatory bowel disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26007179) and [cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26774676), to name a few.\n\nCurcumin also appears to be very beneficial for reducing inflammation and improving symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (17, 18).\n\nOne randomised controlled trial found that people with metabolic syndrome who took curcumin had significantly reduced levels of the inflammation markers CRP and MDA, compared to those who received a placebo (19).\n\nIn another study, when 80 people with solid cancerous tumours were given 150 mg of curcumin, most of their inflammatory markers decreased much more than those in the control group. Their quality of life score also increased significantly (20).\n\nCurcumin is poorly absorbed when taken on its own, but you can boost its absorption by as much as 2,000% by taking it with Piperine, found in black pepper.\n\nRead [more about Turmeric here](https://lyfebotanicals.com/health/turmeric-benefits/).\n\n### Fish oil\n\nFish oil supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids can improve inflammation in several diseases and conditions.\n\nThey can decrease the inflammation associated with diabetes, heart disease, cancer and many other conditions.\n\nTwo especially beneficial types of omega-3s are Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).\n\nDHA, in particular, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects that reduce cytokine levels and promote gut health. It may also decrease the inflammation and muscle damage that occur after exercise.\n\n### Ginger\n\n![Ginger root has been shown to reduce inflammation.](./fight-inflammation-with-food-02.jpg)\n\n[Ginger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger) has been shown to reduce inflammation, as well as muscle pain and soreness after exercise.\n\nGinger root is commonly ground into powder and added to sweet and savoury dishes.\n\nIt's also commonly used to treat indigestion and nausea, including morning sickness.\n\nTwo components of ginger, Gingerol and Zingerone, may reduce the inflammation linked to colitis, kidney damage, diabetes and breast cancer.\n\nWhen people with diabetes were given 1,600 mg of ginger daily, their CRP, insulin and HbA1c levels decreased significantly more than the control group.\n\nAnother study found that women with breast cancer who took ginger supplements had lower CRP and IL-6 levels, especially when combined with exercise\n\n### Grapes, blueberries and other fruits with purple skin.\n\nResveratrol, a type of natural phenol (stilbenoid), and a phytoalexin produced by several plants, may reduce several inflammatory markers and provide other health benefits.\n\nIt's found in fruits with purple skin, red wine and peanuts.\n\nResveratrol may reduce inflammation in individuals with heart disease, insulin resistance, gastritis, ulcerative colitis and other conditions.\n\nOne study gave people with ulcerative colitis 500 mg of Resveratrol daily. Their symptoms improved and they had reductions in the inflammation markers CRP, TNF and NF-kB.\n\nIn another study, Resveratrol supplements lowered inflammatory markers, triglycerides and blood sugar in people with obesity.\n\n### Spirulina\n\nSpirulina provides antioxidant protection that can reduce inflammation and may improve symptoms of certain diseases.\n\nStudies have shown that it reduces inflammation, leads to healthier agin and may strengthen the immune system.\n\nAlthough most research to date has investigated Spirulina's effects on animals, studies in elderly men and women have shown that it may improve inflammatory markers, anaemia and immune function.\n\nWhen people with diabetes were given 8 grams of spirulina per day for 12 weeks, their levels of the inflammation marker MDA decreased.\n\nAdditionally, their levels of Adiponectin increased. This is a hormone involved in regulating blood sugar and fat metabolism.\n\nIn general, it's best to get your anti-inflammatory nutrients from whole foods.\n\nHowever, in the case of excessive or chronic inflammation, supplements can often help bring things back into balance.\n\n## Know More Links\n\n[Curcumin - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcumin)\n\n[Ginger - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger)\n\n[6 anti-inflammatory supplements - Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/6-anti-inflammatory-supplements)\n\n[Health benefits of Turmeric - Lyfebotanicals](https://lyfebotanicals.com/health/turmeric-benefits/)\n\n[Turmeric for inflammation - Lyfebotanicals](https://lyfebotanicals.com/health/turmeric-for-inflammation/)\n\n[Turmeric for your mood - Lyfebotanicals](https://lyfebotanicals.com/health/turmeric-for-depression/)\n\n[Health effects of turmeric and curcumin](https://manyeats.com/health-effects-of-turmeric-and-curcumin/)","src/content/posts/fight-inflammation-with-food/index.md",[1747,1748],"./fight-inflammation-with-food.jpg","./fight-inflammation-with-food-02.jpg","e95e42d5748605b6",{"html":1751,"metadata":1752},"\u003Cp>Inflammation can occur in response to trauma, illness and stress.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It can also be caused by unhealthy foods and lifestyle habits.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Anti-inflammatory foods, exercise, good sleep and stress management can help.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"turmeric-and-curcumin\">Turmeric and Curcumin\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./fight-inflammation-with-food.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Curcumin or Turmeric provides several impressive health benefits.&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcumin\">Curcumin\u003C/a> is a component of the spice Turmeric.

One cup of fresh, chopped leaves (21 grams) contains:\n\n- Protein: 2 grams\n- Vitamin B6: 19% of the [RDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Reference_Intake)\n- Vitamin C: 12% of the RDA\n- Iron: 11% of the RDA\n- Riboflavin (B2): 11% of the RDA\n- Vitamin A (from beta-carotene): 9% of the RDA\n- Magnesium: 8% of the RDA\n\nIn Western countries, the dried leaves are sold as dietary supplements, either in powder or capsule form. Compared to the leaves, the pods are generally lower in vitamins and minerals. However, they are exceptionally rich in vitamin C.

Before you grab a can of chemical bug spray, you can take a stand against mosquitoes with a few well-chosen plants.\n\nMosquitoes are stimulated by a number of factors when seeking out a blood meal.\n\nInitially, they’re [attracted by the carbon dioxide we exhale.](http://theconversation.com/health-check-why-mosquitoes-seem-to-bite-some-people-more-36425)\n\nBody heat is probably important too, but once the mosquito gets closer, she will respond to the smell of a potential blood source’s skin.\n\n# Outdoors mosquito repellent plants\n\n## Garlic - (Allium Sativum)\n\n![Garlic plant](./mosquito-repellent-plants-03.jpg)\n\n[Garlic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garlic) is another natural way to stay away from mosquitoes. You can use it by chopping it in small pieces and spread it around your living areas.\n\nA patio spray can also be made. You can also mix it with natural aromatic oils to make a mosquito repelling body spray. Or simply grow a garlic plant in your garden.\n\nIn addition to growing the plants or herbs mentioned above, you can also practice good mosquito control in your backyard so that the bugs don’t get out of hand.\n\nThe best thing you can do is - prevent water from collecting as the mosquitoes can lay a number of eggs here. Prevention is always better than cure. Get [garlic extract](https://amzn.to/3xNpGng) here, you can also [get odorless ones](https://amzn.to/3m8hwE9).\n\n## Peppermint - (Mentha × piperita)\n\n![Mint plant](./mosquito-repellent-plants-02.jpg)\n\nMost bugs despise the smell and taste of [peppermint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppermint), so planting it around your home is a great way to keep them from dropping by uninvited.\n\nPlus, if you do happen to get bitten, peppermint leaves rubbed directly onto the skin make a great bite relief treatment.\n\nAn added bonus is the wonderful minty smell that makes a delicious addition to food and beverages. Get [peppermint seeds here](https://amzn.to/3iKA6zM) and [here](https://amzn.to/2VR2WFZ).\n\n# Indoor houseplants\n\n## Citronella - (Cymbopogon nardus)\n\n![Citronella plant](./mosquito-repellent-plants-04.jpg)\n\nThis is by far the most well-known mosquito repellent because the compounds in its leaves are a common ingredient in commercial repellent products. It has a pleasant lemon smell and is very powerful at driving away mosquitoes.\n\n[Citronella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citronella), a tropical plant, it will thrive in warm weather and full sunshine.\n\nIt may benefit from regular fertilising and even a little added artificial light during the winter months if you have very short days.\n\nIf looking to buy citronella, be careful when choosing the plants.\n\nThere are a few varieties of scented geraniums that go by the name mosquito plant or even citronella plant, and they are not what you’re looking for.\n\nTrue citronella looks a lot like thick grass, and does not have wide rippled leaves. Citronella [seeds are available here](https://amzn.to/3jS9Fb0) and [here](https://amzn.to/3xGVCK1).\n\n## Lavender - (Lavandula)\n\n![Lavender plant](./mosquito-repellent-plants-05.jpg)\n\n[Lavender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavandula) is an excellent mosquito repellent. Much more common as an outdoor plant, you can keep a few small pots of it inside to help with the bugs.\n\nIt can be finicky, liking as much sun as you can find as well as a spot with good airflow. A nearby window with a frequent breeze is what you need. Get [non GMO Citronella seeds here](https://amzn.to/3iGDk7v) and [here](https://amzn.to/3yMDqQJ).\n\n## Catnip - (Nepeta Cataria)\n\n![Catnip plant](./mosquito-repellent-plants-06.jpg)\n\n[Catnip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catnip) is also an effective mosquito repellent. Nepetalactone is one of the main active ingredients in Catnip, which was found to be 10 times stronger than even DEET, according to a recent study.\n\nCatnip is also a good non-toxic substitute to traditional chemical sprays. Catnip [spray available here](https://amzn.to/37Ia2iw) and here you can [buy Catnip seeds](https://amzn.to/3sen0hz) and make your own plants.\n\n## Basil - (Ocimum basilicum)\n\n![Basil plant](./mosquito-repellent-plants-07.jpg)\n\n[Basil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil) is already a great herb to have fresh in the kitchen, and now you can consider a pest repellent too. As usual, plan on keeping your potted basil in a very sunny window as it needs a lot of light, and be diligent about watering it.\n\nIn folk medicine practices, such as those of _Ayurveda_ or traditional Chinese medicine, basil is thought to have therapeutic properties. Get [Ayurveda Idiot's Guide](https://amzn.to/3iLETBb) here, its a ctually a good book!\n\nBasil doesn’t handle dry conditions very well, but you also don’t want to drown the roots. Damp, well-draining soil is the key.\n\nThey prefer a warm environment, so they may not be the best indoor houseplant if you have a cold house during the winters.\n\nOtherwise, they should thrive just fine. Feel free to harvest a few leaves now and again for cooking too. Oragic [Basil seeds here](https://amzn.to/3iJ6T8l).\n\n## Rosemary - (Salvia Rosmarinus)\n\n![Rosemary plant](./mosquito-repellent-plants-08.jpg)\n\nAnother seasoning herb that has mosquito-repelling qualities is [rosemary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary).\n\nMaybe not the best choice for a novice gardener, but it would be worth giving a try.\n\nYou need a place with as much sunlight as possible, even a grow light occasionally, and you should know it can be finicky about watering.\n\nUse a well-draining potting soil mix, watering when the surface is dry to the touch. It can be sensitive to either too much or too little water.\n\nRosemary is also prone to powdery mildew so you have to have a lot of air movement around the plant to prevent that from settling in. Seeds [available here](https://amzn.to/2VSauZa).\n\nLike with lavender, try to find a breezy location, or even set up a small fan around your plants to keep the air moving.\n\n# Placement\n\nKeep your plants in a spot offer the right amount of light or temperatures your indoor plants require. Choose strategic areas.\n\nKeep your plants near busy entrances. Bedrooms and common living areas are the next placement spots, to keep them out of the room.\n\nRemember, these plants only repel mosquitoes, they aren’t going to kill the bugs.\n\n# Stop Attracting Them\n\nYou’ll have fewer mosquitoes to deal with around the house if you stop attracting them in the first place.\n\nUnlike with other houseflies, mosquitoes aren’t attracted to food or garbage that might be in your house. So keeping things clean won’t have much impact here.\n\nThey’re drawn to the dark colours, body heat and a range of fragrances, including perfumes, lotions and even strong body odour.\n\nNow, these aren’t things that are likely to bring them directly into your house, but if you are outdoors wearing dark clothes and smelling of cologne, you’re going to draw mosquitoes inside with you every time you come back in the house.\n\nMosquitoes are usually at their busiest at dusk and into the night, though not all species are exactly the same.\n\nThis is definitely the time to be careful you’re not drawing them into the house by opening the doors too often, or attracting them as we mentioned above.\n\n# Other advices\n\nIt’s definitely worth putting a little extra effort in keeping your home and yard mosquito free. The biggest way to protect the house is to have tight window screens on every window and exposed vent in your house.\n\nGet rid of any stagnant or standing water in your yard as much as possible. That’s where mosquitoes lay their eggs, which can lead to huge population explosions around the house when they mature.\n\nOpen water barrels, decorative ponds and unused kiddy pools are all a potential breeding ground for mosquitoes.\n\nDrain pools or other horizontal_spacings when not needed, and consider adding lids or screening to places you can’t drain.\n\nA little solar-powered bubbler would keep water moving in a pond enough to prevent insect development without sacrificing the water feature. Mosquitoes won’t lay eggs in moving water.\n\nThese can be a more natural option that treating a pond with chemical pesticides.\n\nDepending on where you live, mosquitoes are very much a seasonal pest and their numbers are at their highest during the summer, and sometimes the late spring if the weather is warm enough.\n\nThey also need the water of spring rains for over-wintered eggs to hatch. These are the times to make sure you have thriving plants in the house to keep out the mosquitoes.\n\nSo with a few of these aromatic plants, and some simple changes around the house, you can have a more mosquito-free summer without having to resort to chemical sprays.\n\n## Know More Links\n\n[Garlic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garlic)\n\n[Peppermint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppermint)\n\n[Citronella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citronella)\n\n[Lavender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavandula)\n\n[Catnip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catnip)\n\n[Basil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil)\n\n[Rosemary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary)\n\n[Attracted by the carbon dioxide we exhale](http://theconversation.com/health-check-why-mosquitoes-seem-to-bite-some-people-more-36425)\n\n[Grow mosquito repellent plants](https://krishijagran.com/health-lifestyle/easy-to-grow-mosquito-repellent-plants-at-home/)\n\n[Plants that repel mosquitoes](https://www.proflowers.com/blog/plants-that-repel-mosquitoes)\n\n[Peppermint oil for rats - howigetridof.com](https://howigetridof.com/peppermint-oil-for-rats/)\n\n[Ayurvedic Herbs supplements](https://amzn.to/3iR0WXn)\n\n[Living Ayurveda: Nourishing Body and Mind through Seasonal Recipes, Rituals, and Yoga](https://amzn.to/2VT2zuN)","src/content/posts/mosquito-repellent-plants/index.md",[2222,2223,2224,2225,2226,2227,2228,2229],"./mosquito-repellent-plants-03.jpg","./mosquito-repellent-plants-02.jpg","./mosquito-repellent-plants-04.jpg","./mosquito-repellent-plants-05.jpg","./mosquito-repellent-plants-06.jpg","./mosquito-repellent-plants-07.jpg","./mosquito-repellent-plants-08.jpg","./mosquito-repellent-plants.jpg","13a1b0a2f2872322",{"html":2232,"metadata":2233},"\u003Cdiv class=\"tldr\">\n\u003Ch2 id=\"tldr\">TLDR\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Mosquitoes are attracted by the carbon dioxide we exhale.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Many plant repels mosquitos and some can alleviate the bite hitch.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Get rid of any stagnant or standing water in your yard and get one of the plants illustrated here to ahve a more peaceful life.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>Mosquitoes can be a terrible nuisance.

Now is the time to act.\" _Dr. Sylvia Earle_\n\nUnder Dr. Earle’s leadership, the Mission Blue team implements communications campaigns that elevate Hope Spots to the world stage through documentaries, social media, traditional media and innovative tools like Google Earth.\n\n![Hope Spot](./raising-awareness-05.jpg)\n\nOur Hope Spots are championed by local conservationists whom we support with communications, expeditions and scientific advisory.\n\n> \"I wish you would use all means at your disposal – films, expeditions, the web, new submarines, campaigns – to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas, Hope Spots large enough to save and restore the ocean, the blue heart of the planet\" _Dr. Sylvia Earle_\n\nMission Blue also embarks on regular oceanic expeditions that shed light on these vital ecosystems and build support for their protection.\n\n![vital ecosystems](./raising-awareness-08.jpg)\n\nIn 2020, the Mission Blue alliance includes more than 200 respected ocean conservation groups and like-minded organizations, from large multinational companies to individual scientific teams doing important research.\n\n![scientific research](./raising-awareness-02.jpg)\n\nMission Blue supports the work of conservation NGOs that share the mission of building public support for ocean protection.\n\nWith the concerted effort and passion of people and organizations around the world, Hope Spots can become a reality and form a global network of marine protected areas large enough to restore the ocean, the blue heart of the planet.\n\n## HOPE SPOTS\n\nWhile about 12 percent of the land around the world is now under some form of protection (as national parks etc.), less than six percent of the ocean is protected in any way.\n\nHope Spots allow us to plan for the future and look beyond current marine protected areas (MPAs), which are like national parks on land where exploitative uses like fishing and deep sea mining are restricted.\n\n![less than six percent of the ocean is protected](./raising-awareness-07.jpg)\n\nHope Spots are often areas that need new protection, but they can also be existing MPAs where more action is needed.\n\nThey can be large, they can be small, but they all provide hope due to:\n\n- A special abundance or diversity of species, unusual or representative species, habitats or ecosystems.\n\n- Particular populations of rare, threatened or endemic species.\n\n- A site with potential to reverse damage from negative human impacts.\n\n- The presence of natural processes such as major migration corridors or spawning grounds.\n\n- Significant historical, cultural or spiritual values of particular economic importance to the community.\n\nThe idea is that anyone can nominate a site special to him or her, a site that gives HOPE.\n\nCollectively all of these Hope Spots will create a global wave of community support for ocean conservation that leaders and policy makers can’t ignore.\n\n![create a global wave of community support](./raising-awareness-03.jpg)\n\n## HOPE SPOT EXPEDITIONS\n\nSince 2008, Mission Blue expeditions have visited Hope Spots around the world, documenting these vibrant marine environments and engaging local stakeholders to protect them.\n\n![engaging local stakeholders to protect the environment](./raising-awareness-04.jpg)\n\nLed by Dr. Sylvia Earle and Expeditions Director Kip Evans, these voyages explore our most critical ocean habitats.\n\nDesigned to create awareness, foster partnerships and build broad public support for the

Some have artistic skills, others are good with numbers or have a way with words. Everyone has power to make a difference as an individual, or by joining the company of others who share a common goal. The key is in knowing that what you do matters, including doing nothing!\" _Dr. Sylvia Earle_\n\n_Mission Blue depends on the generosity of people to explore and protect Hope Spots. Every dollar donated helps our continued efforts to inspire a world where the ocean is protected and respected._\n\n_Now, as never before, we have the chance to save what’s left of the living systems that support life on our planet. We should act as if our lives depend on a healthy ocean, because they do._\n\n## Know More Links\n\n[About Mission Blue](https://mission-blue.org/about/)\n\n[Mission Blue - Hope Spots](https://mission-blue.org/hope-spots/)\n\n[Mission Blue - Instagram](https://instagram.com/mission_blue/)\n\n[Mission Blue - Twitter](https://twitter.com/missionblue/)\n\n[Nusa Penida Marine Protected Area](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/45f1af5ffaaa4eb29c6b72f0fb498ded)\n\n[Timor-Leste Hope Spot](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/5fc1a8d6ae864233919d5cd54ba75faa?utm_source=Mission+Blue+Newsletter&utm_campaign=a0c0f5afa0-july2020&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_da58e310c1-a0c0f5afa0-320797301&mc_cid=a0c0f5afa0&mc_eid=9f56f752f9)","src/content/posts/raising-awareness/index.md",[2389,2390,2391,2392,2393,2394,2395,2396,2397],"./raising-awareness-10.jpg","./raising-awareness-05.jpg","./raising-awareness-08.jpg","./raising-awareness-02.jpg","./raising-awareness-07.jpg","./raising-awareness-03.jpg","./raising-awareness-04.jpg","./raising-awareness-09.jpg","./raising-awareness.jpg","74746fb0af5009a7",{"html":2400,"metadata":2401},"\u003Cdiv class=\"tldr\">\n\u003Ch2 id=\"tldr\">TLDR\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Mission Blue embarks on regular oceanic expeditions that shed light on these vital ecosystems and implements communications campaigns.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>They created a global network of marine protected areas, called Hope Spots.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Since 2008, Mission Blue expeditions have visited Hope Spots around the world, documenting these vibrant marine environments and engaging local stakeholders to protect them.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>The goal is to inspire action to protect these critical ocean habitats.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>Led by famous oceanographer Dr. Sylvia Earle, Mission Blue inspires action to explore and protect the ocean.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Uniting a global coalition to inspire an upwelling of public awareness, access and support for a worldwide network of marine protected areas, Hope Spots, special places that are scientifically identified as critical to the health of the ocean.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./raising-awareness-10.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;health of the ocean&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“The next five years may be the most important in the next ten thousand for our planet.

Corner House, Burkill Hall, Holttum Hall, Ridley Hall, House 6, Garage, Bandstand and Swan Lake Gazebo.\n\n## Rain Forest\n\nSome 314 species of plants jostle for space in this precious six-hectare fragment of primary tropical forest, forming a multi-layered ecosystem of herbs and ferns, climbers, shrubs, and trees.\n\nSome trees reach 50 m. in height, and were here even before the founding of modern Singapore in 1819.\n\nAmong the rich species of plants found in the Rain Forest are trees of economic importance, such as rattans, fruit trees and the towering Jelutong.\n\nWith more than 50% of its species representing plants that are rare in Singapore, the Rain Forest certainly qualifies as a part of Singapore’s natural heritage.\n\n### Healing Garden\n\nThe Healing Garden showcases over 400 varieties of plants used medicinally. It' i's laid out thematically relating to component parts of the body such as head, respiratory and reproductive systems.\n\n![Artemisia, the ancient, and still the best, cure for Malaria, used in Moksa Cinese Medicine.](./singapore-botanic-gardens-04.jpg)\n\nSpread over 2.5 hectares, it's designed as a tranquil retreat with medicinal plants traditionally used in Southeast Asia as the main focus. Here you can discover the power of plants to heal and enhance our quality of life.\n\nPlant's information featured in the Healing Garden, which closes on Tuesdays, is intended for educational purposes only.\n\nAll informations and recommendations are a good starting point to self-diagnose, self-prescribe, self-treat and cure diseases or illness.\n\n### Ginger Garden\n\nOn displays here several hundred species of gingers and related families. Walk behind a waterfall, romantic night lighting and a pool adorned with giant Amazon water lilies, the Ginger Garden is very popular among visitors.\n\nThe one-hectare Ginger Garden, organised by their regions of origin, contains more than 250 species of members from the family [Zingiberaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zingiberaceae) and its relatives.\n\nVisitors are treated to a wide array of gingers in all shapes and forms, many with surprisingly beautiful leaves and very attractive flowers.\n\n### Learning Forest\n\nThe Learning Forest is located in the new Tyersall-Gallop Core of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. It is designed to integrate with the existing 6-hectare Rain Forest to form an enlarged forest habitat.\n\nThe Learning Forest features a network of boardwalks and elevated walkways that allow visitors to explore habitats ranging from a freshwater forest wetland to a lowland rainforest.\n\n![Ficus Kerkhovenii at Singapore botanic gardens.](./singapore-botanic-gardens-03.jpg)\n\nVisitors can learn about freshwater forest wetland ecosystems at the Keppel Discovery Wetlands and walk amongst a collection of some of the tallest tree species in Southeast Asia at the SPH Walk of Giants.\n\nOther highlights of the Learning Forest include themed collections showcasing trees with interesting forms and bark, a bambusetum, and an arboretum of wild fruit trees.\n\n**Wild Fruit Trees Arboretum**\n\nThe collection of wild fruit trees features wild relatives of familiar and domesticated species, such as species from the [Soursop (Annonaceae)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soursop), [Jackfruit (Moraceae)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackfruit), [Lychee (Sapindaceae)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychee) and [Mango (Anarcardiaceae)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mango) families.\n\n**Bambusetum**\n\nOver 30 species of tropical bamboos, showcasing the wide diversity of growth forms that occur naturally in the wild.\n\n**Bark of Trees**\n\nExposition of the diversity of textures and colours exhibited by trees in their bark.\n\n**Products of the Forest**\n\nThis collection features forest plants that are cultivated for human uses such as timber, building materials and food.\n\n**Durian Theory**\n\nThis part of the Learning Forest features tree species with specialised growth forms that inspired EJH Corner to formulate his 'Durian Theory'.\n\nCorner postulated that many of today's plants are descended from tree species with large fruit similar to durians.\n\n### Foliage Garden\n\nThe Foliage Garden will be a new and unique themed attraction at the Singapore Botanic Gardens.\n\nConveniently located next to the car park at Cluny Park Gate and opposite The Garage building, the Foliage Garden extends a warm welcome to visitors with an extensive collection of terrestrial and aquatic foliage.\n\nIt showcases a wide array of ornamental plants with colourful foliage of varying shapes and textures and demonstrates that the beauty and diversity of plants does not lie in their flowers alone.\n\n![Singapore botanic gardens.](./singapore-botanic-gardens.jpg)\n\nVisitors can expect to spot interesting carnivorous plants such as Nepenthes or pitcher plants.\n\nThese plants have evolved to adapt to nutrient-poor environments where most obtain their nutrients from trapping and digesting insects.\n\nOne of the most notable specimens on display, the 'giant' form of Raffles’ Pitcher Plant, Nepenthes rafflesiana, can be easily spotted by its distinct red cups and large funnel shaped upper pitches.\n\nA stroll on the boardwalk in the garden also offers a brilliant view of aquatic plants like the Lotus, Nelumbo nucifera.\n\n**Leaf variegation**\n\nThe varying colours of the leaves in the foliage garden is one thing that will be hard to miss. This is known as variegation and it is attributed to many factors such as genetics or pigmentation.\n\n![Singapore botanic gardens.](./singapore-botanic-gardens-08.jpg)\n\nFor instance, plants bearing genetic leaf variegation, chimeras, lack chlorophyll in some tissues, causing their leaves to appear yellow or white in some areas.\n\nPigmentation can also be a cause for variegation where other pigments present mask the green pigment of chlorophyll.\n\nThis is the case with some Begonia species, where the presence of pigmented hairs cause the green leaves to appear red.\n\nVariegated leaves are widely used to brighten up gardens and add dimension and structure.\n\n**Shapes and textures of leaves**\n\nThe foliage garden also presents an eye-opening range of various leaf shapes and textures. Different plants adapt differently to the habitats that they grow in.\n\nLeaves come in many forms such as heart (cordate) or palm (palmate) shaped.\n\n![Singapore botanic gardens.](./singapore-botanic-gardens-07.jpg)\n\nLeathery or thin leaves are adaptive modifications to hot and humid tropical weather. Hairy leaves, whilst often pleasant to the touch, act as a form of self defence mechanism to deter herbivores.\n\n### Library of Botany and Horticulture\n\nFounded in 1875, the Singapore Botanic Gardens is one of the oldest specialized libraries in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe Library holds over 30,000 accessioned items, a rare and irreplaceable resource that supports the work of the Gardens staff, students, and researchers across the globe in a diverse range of science and horticulture disciplines.\n\n![Singapore botanic gardens.](./singapore-botanic-gardens-06.jpg)\n\nThe collection contains books, periodicals, field books, botanical artwork, historical maps of the Gardens and various other print and digital media.\n\nThe Library is equipped with Wireless@SG wifi service. [More information about the library](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/sbg/research/library-of-botany-and-horticulture).\n\nThe Library’s collections are held in two areas: the Public Reference Library (unrestricted access & open to public) and the Staff Library (restricted access).\n\n70% the [Library Catalogue is searchable here](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/sbg/research/library-of-botany-and-horticulture/search-our-library)\n\n### Eco-Garden and Eco-Lake\n\nThe perfect place for bird-watching and the learning of economically important plants.\n\n### Sun Garden\n\nSucculents and other plants of arid regions. This includes cacti and euphorbias and other drought-tolerant species such as agaves, yuccas and grass trees.\n\nSucculents have fleshy leaves or stems that store water.\n\nIn stem succulents, the stems may be green and take over from the leaves as the main organs of photosynthesis.\n\nA drainage system installed here help to simulate the dry conditions required to grow this collection.\n\n### Jacob Ballas Children's Garden\n\nThe first garden in Asia dedicated to children, it aims to educate and instill love for nature.\n\nThe garden is a complete nature-learning environment, where children can delve deeper into the ecology of plants and our environment through discovery and experiential learning.\n\nThe Garden offers children a space for exploration, adventure and play, with a farm, an orchard, and a forest with its own stream and ponds.\n\nYoung adventure seekers can explore the suspension bridge and nature play areas.\n\nBudding naturalists can walk along the stream and climb into the tree-houses.\n\nUrban gardeners can observe how plants grow and pick up some gardening tips! Here kids can be an ‘Adventurer’, ‘Gardener’ or ‘Naturalist’ for a day.\n\n### Evolution Gardens\n\nA journey through time, from the beginnings of our planet to the first living organisms and gradually changing plant life on land. This 1.5-hectare garden offers displays designed to enrich and educate. Magnificent Tree Ferns & Cycads are the ‘Jurassic Park’ centrepiece here.\n\n### Trellis Garden\n\nThe Trellis Garden showcases the Singapore Botanic Gardens’ climber collection.

Whether you’re a forest manager, product manufacturer, retailer, or any number of other kinds of company, you can apply for FSC certification.\n\nBeing FSC certified means that your forest, or supply chain, is managed responsibly; that you comply with our environmental, social, and economic standards. This covers much more than the trees themselves, among other things, it makes sure that local communities are respected, protects the habitats of endangered plant and animal species, and ensures workers are properly paid.\n\n![Look for the logo before your next purchase](./sustainable-wood-02.jpg)\n\nWhen you become certified, your product can carry an [FSC label](https://ic.fsc.org/en/for-business/business-benefits/fsc-labels). It is a trusted symbol that shows consumers and businesses that you are sustainably managing either your forest, by preserving it for future generations, or supply chain operations. It is public recognition of your responsibility.\n\n### Why should you choose FSC certification?\n\nWe are not the only forest management system, but our certification is credible, which, in turn, helps protect your brand and reputation. More and more organizations and governments specify FSC-certified materials must be used in procurement processes.\n\nMeanwhile, WWF even recommends FSC certification to consumers, forest managers, and businesses. Why? Because FSC is trusted not just by NGOs. FSC certification is the most widely adopted framework among Fortune 500 companies.\n![Types of certification](./sustainable-wood-03.jpg)\n\nAside from showing the world your commitment to responsible forestry, FSC certification has other [business benefits](https://ic.fsc.org/en/benefits-for-business): it’s been proven that many businesses can receive financial benefits from being FSC certified (according to this [WWF cost-benefit report](http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?250330)).\n\n### There are two types of FSC certification\n\n[FSC forest management certification](https://ic.fsc.org/en/for-business/business-benefits/forest-management-certification) is awarded for responsible management of a forest or plantation area.\n\nWood, and other tree-based products, sourced from forests can undergo many processes before they become a product, so FSC chain of custody certification tracks FSC-certified material from forest to store.\n\n### What's the certification cost?\n\nThe individual certification bodies that carry out assessments on behalf of FSC each determine their own fees. There is also an [annual administration fee (AAF)](https://ic.fsc.org/en/document-center/id/308) that you’ll pay through your certification body as part of your annual FSC certification audit.\n\nThe AAF was established to support the core FSC functions and services provided to certificate holders. The fee you pay is dependent on the type of certification you hold, the size, and type, of your forest area or site, and your annual turnover.\n\n### Trademark licensing: an alternative to certification\n\nIf you’re a retailer, media organization, or educational institution, for example, you might not want or need to become certified, but may still want to promote FSC-labelled products or FSC certification as a framework. For these situations, FSC offer [trademark licensing](https://ic.fsc.org/en/for-business/how-to-use-fsc-trademarks).\n\n## Know More Links\n\nBecoming certified: [steps](https://ic.fsc.org/en/for-business/3-steps-to-certification)\n\nForest Stewardship Council [website](https://ic.fsc.org/en)\n\nFSC [list of national websites](http://fsc.org/)","src/content/posts/sustainable-wood/index.md",[2752,2753,2754],"./sustainable-wood-02.jpg","./sustainable-wood-03.jpg","./sustainable-wood.jpg","8560cd845b33f2f3",{"html":2757,"metadata":2758},"\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>The future of the world’s forests is very important to the planet, to animals, to businesses, to all of us.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That’s why FSC certification exists.
