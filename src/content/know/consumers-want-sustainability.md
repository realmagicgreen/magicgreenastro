Environmental consciousness, social responsibility, and sustainability are all hot button topics in consumer retail today. The real question is: do these topics really matter to consumers?

Two interesting research studies set out to find the answer to this question. Here's what those studies revealed.

30,000 consumers in 60 countries, polled by a recent [Nielsen Global Survey](http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/press-room/2014/global-consumers-are-willing-to-put-their-money-where-their-heart-is.html) on Corporate Social Responsibility, are willing to pay more for products and services provided by companies that are committed to positive social and environmental impact.

## Buy socially responsible brands

The propensity to buy socially responsible brands is strongest in Asia-Pacific (64%), Latin America (63%) and Middle East/Africa (63%). The numbers for North America and Europe are 42 and 40%, respectively.

Here is some data from the study:

- **52% of respondents had purchased at least one product or service in the past six months from a socially responsible company.**

- **52%% of global respondents said their sustainable purchase decisions are influenced by packaging.**

- **Of those who will pay extra for sustainable products those who check the packaging for sustainable labeling, 51% are Millennials.**

## Consumers interest

So, have consumers cooled in their interest for eco-friendly packaging since then? Not at all.

The Hartman Group's [Sustainability 2015: Transparency](http://store.hartman-group.com/sustainability-2015-transparency/?hcampaign) clearly shows that consumers are still concerned about the environment and are calling more than ever for transparency and socially responsible packaging design choices.

When respondents were asked "When deciding which foods and beverages to purchase, what is most important to you?" 22% replied that minimal/eco-friendly packaging was their main consideration.

Here are some other statistics of note from the Hartman Group study:

- **64% of respondents said it was important for packaging to be recyclable.**

- **53% said it was important for packaging to be biodegradable.**

- **53% said it was important for packaging to be made of recycled materials.**

- **52% said it was important for packaging to be minimal**

Commenting on the study, [PackWorld.com](https://www.packworld.com/article/sustainability/material-health/infographic-how-important-eco-friendly-packaging-purchase) observes: "Although a product's essential content and use are more strongly emphasized by consumers, earth-friendly packaging may be a first step for manufacturers in creating a more environmentally responsible halo for its products."
