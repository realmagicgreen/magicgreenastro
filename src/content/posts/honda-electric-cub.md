The new Honda EV-Cub is definitely an eyebrow raiser. Two electric motors, one in the front, the other in the back. Sure this is unique. I only know of a few electric bikes that have that configuration, which, by the way, is plenty of fun in the right conditions.

Is the Honda EV-Cub going to show more performance than its gasoline counterpart? Surely, that would cannibalize its regular Cub market.

> "Possibly we will sell Honda EV-Cub globally in 2018, including in Indonesia" _Shinji Aoyama, Honda Japan_

One positive and intriguing system Honda is working on is called LOOP, a communications system for EV-Cub riders that relies on solar power. It’s described as a portable device for rider-to-rider and passenger communications.

The battery will be detachable, which we have come to expect on smaller two-wheeled EVs.

Currently Honda is working with Panasonic to develop electric motor batteries for the Indonesian market. To note Honda EV Cub was only able to drive about 70 km.
