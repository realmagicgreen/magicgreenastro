Flax seeds are nutritional powerhouses. They're absolutely packed with fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, antioxidants, and cancer-fighting [lignans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignan).

Flaxseed contains 75 to 800 times more lignans than other plant foods.

We only need a few teaspoons of seeds a day to benefit from their healthfulness.

You can eat them raw, grind them and adding them to salads, soups or to your baking mix.
