**Sansevieria Trifasciata**, also called mother-in-law's tongue, is one of the most recommended plants for improving indoor air quality.

An evergreen perennial plant which, like Aloe Vera, emits oxygen at night.

As houseplants, Sansevieria thrive on warmth and bright light, but will also tolerate shade.

They can rot from over-watering, so it is important that they are potted in well-drained soil, and not over-watered.

The [NASA Clean Air Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Clean_Air_Study) found Sansevieria trifasciata has air purification qualities, removing 4 of the 5 main toxins.

It exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide using the crassulacean acid metabolism process, unique because few plant species have adapted it.

It allows them to withstand drought.

The microscopic pores on the plant's leaves, called the stomata and used to exchange gases, are only opened at night to prevent water from escaping via evaporation in the hot sun.

**Pollutants removed**: benzene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, toluene and xylene
