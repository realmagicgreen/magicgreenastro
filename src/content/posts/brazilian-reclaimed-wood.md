Peroba is a common tree in Brazil, local craftsmen use its wood for everything. From the strong, straight-grained stock that resembles oak, they build entire houses using it for framing, paneling, millwork, moldings, flooring, and furniture.

It is also called [Aspidosperma polyneuron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspidosperma_polyneuron) is a timber tree native to Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, and Paraguay. It is common in Atlantic Forest vegetation. It is useful also for beekeeping.
