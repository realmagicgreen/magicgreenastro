## TLDR

Block printing technique is super fun and easy once you know the basics.

You can print fabric, paper or whatever, just pick the right type of ink.

Wood blocks are longer lasting so that can be printed again and again. But if you’re not creating a huge edition of prints, vegetable or fruit block is the way to go.

Block printing is the process of printing onto fabric or paper using a hand-cut block, usually made of wood.

After carving the block, applying ink, then printing begins. Hence, the name block printing.

A two thousand years technique probably originated in China, where it remained the most common printing method for books and images until the 1800s.

To carve into wood blocks, you need a proper set of tools.

Wood carving tools can be expensive since they have two be stronger, sharper, etc.

Wood blocks are longer lasting compared to veggies so that can be printed again and again.
