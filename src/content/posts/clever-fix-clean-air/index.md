Yes, approach safety which makes sense! 



## TLDR
In Italian, CALCE refers to lime (calcium hydroxide), a crucial component in ancient Roman construction. The Romans’ innovative use of lime, particularly through ‘hot mixing’ techniques, endowed their concrete with self-healing properties. This approach allowed their structures to endure for over 2,000 years, as the lime would expand and seal micro-cracks upon exposure to water, effectively enabling the concrete to repair itself over time.

  

## Here’s how, step by step

**Step 1: Prepare the lime-wash CALCE

lime-wash is breathable, natural, and ideal for your purpose since it whitens the walls and acts as a binder.

  

## **Materials Needed:**

• **Hydrated Lime (Calcium Hydroxide)**: Available at building or masonry supply stores.

• **Water**: For diluting the lime.

• **Natural Pigments (Optional)**: If you want to tint the lime-wash.

• **Bucket**: For mixing.

• **Paintbrush or Roller**: For application.

  

## **Preparation:**

1. In a bucket, mix **1 part hydrated lime** with **3 parts water** (by volume).

2. Stir thoroughly to ensure a smooth, creamy consistency.

3. Let the mixture sit for at least 12 hours to “mature.” This improves adhesion and reduces dusting later.

4. Optionally, add natural pigments to tint the mixture and stir again.

  

**Step 2: Apply the lime-wash**

  

lime-wash will create a natural white coating, ideal for an old house’s walls.

  

**Application:**

1. **Dampen the Walls:** Lightly mist the wall with water using a spray bottle. This helps the lime-wash adhere and prevents it from drying too quickly.

2. **Apply the First Coat:** Use a wide paintbrush or roller to apply a thin layer of lime-wash. Avoid thick coats as they can crack.

3. **Drying Time:** Allow the first coat to dry fully (12-24 hours).

4. **Second Coat (Optional):** Apply a second or third coat if needed, allowing each to dry in between.

  

**Step 3: Seal with Duraseal Zero**

  

Once the lime-wash has cured completely (several days to a week), you can seal it with **Duraseal Zero** to lock in the lime, preventing dust and ensuring a durable finish.

  

### **Sealing Process:**

1. Ensure the lime-washed walls are completely dry and stable.

2. Stir the **Duraseal Zero** thoroughly before use.

3. Using a paintbrush or roller, apply a thin, even layer of the sealer.

4. Allow it to dry per the manufacturer’s instructions (usually a few hours).

5. Apply a second coat if needed for added protection.

  

**Benefits of This Method**

1. **Natural and Breathable:** Lime-wash and Duraseal Zero both allow the walls to breathe, preventing moisture buildup.

2. **Dust-Free Finish:** Sealing the lime-wash prevents the common dusting issue of traditional lime coatings.

3. **Eco-Friendly:** Both lime-wash and Duraseal Zero are non-toxic and sustainable.

  

This combination ensures your walls are white, stabilised, and safe, while maintaining the breathable and aesthetic qualities of lime.
