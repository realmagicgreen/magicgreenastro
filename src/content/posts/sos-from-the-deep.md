Coral Reefs need our help now! More than 27% of the world’s coral reefs are already lost. If we don’t do anything about it, almost all of our coral reefs will be gone by 2050 and there will be more plastics than fish in the ocean!

Why are coral reefs so important for our future? They are complex and very valuable ecosystems and provide habitats for a huge diversity of species.

Coral reefs are critical for the economy supplying food and income and serve as natural barrier against storms, hurricanes and typhoons protecting shorelines.

Time for some serious action! Save the world’s reefs before it’s too late.

Escape Room, SOS from the Deep, is a project of the Coral Triangle Center (CTC).

It is located in CTC’s Center for Marine Conservation in Sanur, Bali. CTC is an Indonesian non-profit organization with a regional scope and global impact.

CTC provides education and training to make sure that marine protected areas within the Coral Triangle are managed effectively.

They support on-the-ground conservation programs through our learning sites in Nusa Penida near Bali and the Banda Islands in Maluku.
