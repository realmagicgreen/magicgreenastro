Bali is at the heart of the Indonesian archipelago stretching 150km wide and 80km from north to south. Its unique variant of Hinduism influences every aspect of island culture, from day-to-day village life to art, dance, food and music.

Located an hour’s drive to the north of Bali’s capital Denpasar, Ubud is already internationally acknowledged for its visual arts and performance, as well as exceptional arts and crafts, making it one of the most important cultural and artistic centres in Indonesia.

Unlike the beach areas, Ubud is laden with rice terraces and river crossings and forests. Coupled with a higher altitude, the overall climate is noticeably cooler than beachside locations in Bali.

The Bambu Kitchen Restaurant is open daily from 6.30am to 10pm and feature local cuisine. It received _'2014 Snail of Approval'_ by complying with **Slow Food** Bali’s guidelines of using at least 75% Indonesia-produced ingredients, sustainably managing the waste and paying fare wages to staff.

Veggies are allowed to ripen on the vine and are foraged every morning for use in the restaurants.

To ensure a healthy garden, only natural fertilizers is used, including compost made from their own organic waste.

Composting diverts waste from landfills, and helps eliminate the need for chemical fertilizers often used in commercial farms.

The Bambu Kitchen Restaurant is working towards being 100% self sufficient, growing all of our fruit, vegetables and herbs on site.

Still sometimes there is a need to buy locally produced items, such as vegetables, coffees, teas, beers and wines.

This ensures to support the local economy, and means that food spends less time in transit, is fresher, seasonal and more nutrient-rich.

The restaurant offer also breakfast and afternoon tea with traditional Balinese sweets.
