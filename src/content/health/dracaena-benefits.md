People use Dracaena for the health benefits they offer. Dracaena, which name comes from ancient greek, meaning female dragon, is a genus of about 120 species of trees and succulent shrubs.

Caring for it is quite easy. It can withstand a certain amount of neglect. A brightly lit spot without direct sunshine is suggested. A small amount of morning or evening sun is not a problem. Avoid having a plant sitting near cold drafts. A fast draining potting soil mix is best to use. Over-watering can kill it.

NASA has spent a lot of time researching air quality in sealed environments. **Dracaena marginata** is among the top 10 plants for removing indoor pollutants, according to the agency.

> "Because indoor air pollution extensively affects developing countries, using plants as a mitigation method could serve as a cost-effective tool in the developing world where expensive pollution mitigation technology may not be economically feasible"_Heather L. Papinchak, Department of Economics, Environmental Resources Management, The Pennsylvania State University_

A World Health Organization air quality model confirms that 92% of the world's population lives in places where air quality levels exceed WHO limits. Some 3 million deaths a year are linked to exposure to outdoor air pollution. Indoor air pollution can be just as deadly. In 2012, an estimated 6.5 million deaths (11.6% of all global deaths) were associated with indoor and outdoor air pollution together.

A study conducted in the University of Agriculture in Norway concluded that houseplants can actually reduce fatigue, sore throats, coughs and a range of other illnesses related to cold. They achieve this by increasing the levels of humidity in a room and reducing dust. In addition to that, the interior plant will regulate humidity in the house by releasing moisture.

**Pollutants removed**: Benzene, Trichloroethylene, Formaldehyde, Carbon dioxide
