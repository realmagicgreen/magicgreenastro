Billions of plastic bags are made each year. Of these bags, one hundred billion are thrown away according to [Worldwatch Institute](http://www.worldwatch.org/), with less than 1 percent finding their way into a recycle bin.

The end result of this is around 1 billion birds and mammals dying each year by the ingestion of plastic.

Now that you know, here is how you can help solving the problem:

- Bring your non-plastic bag when you shop
- Make sure that when you trow it away it goes into the recycle bin.
- Give your customers paper bags instead, at least they are easily recyclable.
