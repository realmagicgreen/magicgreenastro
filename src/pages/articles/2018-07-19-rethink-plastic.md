Some wise people are creating a global movement that encourages all to #RethinkPlastic.

### Social Impact Through Film

A Plastic Ocean’s message raises the awareness of plastic pollution and the existing solutions. We continue to bring this message around the world to national legislatures, city councils, schools, universities and environmental organizations. It is creating policy and social change around the world.

We continue to be humbled by the film impact that [A Plastic Ocean](https://youtu.be/6zrn4-FfbXw) continues to make around the globe.

- Screened in over 70 countries and on 6 continents.

- 1,200 screenings hosted by government agencies, non-profits, schools, universities, individuals, multilateral institutions, corporations, aquariums and many more.

- 14 plus film festival awards.

- subtitled to over 15 languages.

- 22-minute version screened at UN’s Ocean Conference in New York City, to a crowd of over 500 people.

Plastic Oceans Foundation has over 50 partnerships around the globe with non-profits, government agencies, businesses, universities and schools. Highlights of some of these partnerships include phasing out Styrofoam containers in the US Embassy in Peru, changing legislation in Barbados and potentially Australia, reducing plastic consumption in hotels in New York, Phuket, Thailand and more.

Plastic Oceans Foundation has reached over 100,000 Facebook members and has also launched Facebook pages in Barbados, Colombia, Chile and Peru.
