So you like to talk trash huh?

The Trash Hero movement is a global phenomena and is growing bigger. They [educate](https://trashhero.org/edu/) and act.

In Bali too, people are taking it in their own hands. It's Sunday and at the [Bajra Sandhi Monument](https://goo.gl/maps/NB3moggeHCz) you can see a bunch of people wearing yellow T-shirts walking around with recycled rice bag and picking up the plastic trash.

They are part of their local group, [Trash Hero Sanur](http://chapter.trashhero.org/chapters/sanur), which is supported by the following sponsors: **Asli Desain, Cafe Locca Hostel, Sweet Magnolia, the Green Team Sanur**...



The [Trash Hero network](https://trashhero.org/our-network/), which links communities all over the world, is concentrated in Southeast Asia, in Thailand, Indonesia, Myanmar, Malaysia and Singapore, but also extends into Europe, Africa and the USA.
