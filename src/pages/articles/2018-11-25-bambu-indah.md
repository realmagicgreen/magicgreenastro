Bali is at the heart of the Indonesian archipelago stretching 150km wide and 80km from north to south. Its unique variant of Hinduism influences every aspect of island culture, from day-to-day village life to art, dance, food and music.

Veggies are allowed to ripen on the vine and are foraged every morning for use in the restaurants.

To ensure a healthy garden, only natural fertilizers is used, including compost made from their own organic waste.

Composting diverts waste from landfills, and helps eliminate the need for chemical fertilizers often used in commercial farms.

The Bambu Kitchen Restaurant is working towards being 100% self sufficient, growing all of our fruit, vegetables and herbs on site.

Still sometimes there is a need to buy locally produced items, such as vegetables, coffees, teas, beers and wines.

This ensures to support the local economy, and means that food spends less time in transit, is fresher, seasonal and more nutrient-rich.
