The plan is to create Southeast Asia’s no. 1 green destination and attract the world's most engaged green partners and most passionate eco-tourists.

Along the Alas Strait, between Lombok and Sumbawa, East Indonesia, Eco Regions Indonesia are creating two large-scale EcoRegions™ that embrace over 1,000 ha of land and 20,000 ha of water teeming with biodiversity.

Eco Regions' vision is to create a blueprint for sustainable development and to preserve two of Indonesia’s most iconic locations for generations to come.

The Eco Region approach aspire to be a game changer for large scale green development. It simultaneously protects the environment, generates regional development, provides a secure home for investors and involves local people.

Eco Regions secures and environmentally protects large areas of iconic land in cooperation with the Indonesian Government.

The process to be recognised as Special Economic Zones (KEK) will turn each eco-region in a green regional development zone, with its own sustainable regulations, benefits such as reductions in import duties along with government funded infrastructure linking each region to the rest of the country.

### Green Regulations

Each eco-region will have its own set of Sustainability Regulations and Guidelines that apply to all developing partners and businesses. The regulations are more than a legal instrument to ensure environmental values are secured over time, they are an essential part of the strategy to create a real sustainable eco-region and attract partners and visitors committed to the respect for the environment and local culture.

Developed by a team of sustainable architects, environmentally specialised engineers, legislators and environmental activists, the regulations intend to limit and take responsibility for the impact of the development of infrastructure and facilities. To support partners and businesses, comprehensive guidelines are created to illustrate how requirements can be implemented. Eco Regions will offer advice and will monitor performance over time.


### Eight Islands EcoRegion

The Eight Islands EcoRegion™ is an untouched archipelago in Northwest Sumbawa, sitting on a forest of coral, surrounded by crystal clear water perfect for diving, snorkelling, kayaking and stand-up paddling.

The islands vary in size from 1 to 500 ha with different characters, some are ideal for development, others for conservation or day-trip destinations.

The region has the potential to provide a wealth of fruit, vegetables and seafood. Eco Regions are working with the local government, community, permaculture, farming and fishing experts to determine the best sustainable agricultural and fisheries strategy.

**Quick facts**

- Total area 380 ha developable land and +500 ha pristine mangrove areas in a 19,000 ha preserved marine area.

- Tourism facilities: Eco-resorts and villas, the world’s first Earthship Resort™ Island. Biopharma production. Water sports

- Land rights: 206 ha IUPJL permits (forestry land), 176 ha HGB certificate (private land)

- How to get there: 2 hour by ferry from Labuhan Kayangan in northeast Lombok. 1 hour by speed boat from Telongelong in mid-ast Lombok. 10 km from the new planned airport in northwest Sumbawa.

### Tanjung Ringgit EcoRegion

Tanjung Ringgit EcoRegion™ in Southeast Lombok offers untouched white sand beaches, dramatic limestone cliffs, warm ocean waters, pristine dive sites and one of the world’s few pink sand beaches, which owes its colour to a sensitive red coral eco-system.

The footprint of the development is very low, only 10%, preserving 90% of the land for eco-tourism activities, forestry and farming. Working in a protected forest area involves the responsibility to regenerate and protect it.

Thanks to the cooperation with the local community and the Forestry department, biodiversity is thriving; forests are being regenerated, medicinal plants and fruit trees are being planted, beaches are preserved and corals protected. Most of the organic food production for the eco-region and its visitors is planned to take place in the adjacent 2,600 ha Sekaroh forest.

**Quick facts**

- Total area: 343 ha developable land surrounded by a 2,600 ha protected forest.

- Tourism facilities: Eco-resorts and villas, immune therapy hospitals and health and wellness centres, water sports and nature sports – mountain bike trails, horse riding etc.

- Land rights: 339 ha IUPJL permit (forestry land), 4 ha HGB certificate (private land)

>“At a time when some of the most beautiful places in the world are being destroyed by thoughtless developments that damage environments and deprive local people of their land, we believe the time is ripe to set a standard for a new type of development. A development where the needs and desires of the local people are evenly balanced and integrated with environmental considerations and the needs and desires of visitors and investors...” _John Higson, Co-Founder and Executive Director_


The company, which business goal is to sustainably develop large-scale regions for eco-tourism was founded in 2010/2011 and has 32 employees and offices in Singapore, Jakarta and Mataram.
