Epipremnum aureum is an evergreen climber with a multitude of common names including **golden pothos**, hunter's robe, ivy arum, **money plant**, silver vine, Solomon Islands ivy and taro vine.

It is also called **devil's vine** or devil's ivy because it is almost impossible to kill and it stays green even when kept in the dark.

Golden Pothos is one of the top three plants besides Philodendron and Spider plant that has been labeled the most effective in removing formaldehyde.

Pothos, very easy to care for, can grow up to 10 feet tall, and in their natural habitat. It will not flower, but will clean the air. It is known to thrive under fluorescent lights too.

As a creature of the swamp, the money tree plant loves humidity so it's perfect in the bathroom. It can be toxic when ingested, especially for your pets.

Epipremnum aureum can become a highly invasive species when introduced into tropical countries where it is not native.

Having no natural enemies, it completely overgrows the forest floor as well as the trunks of trees, causing severe ecological disruption.

**Pollutants removed**: Formaldehyde, Xylene, Trichloroethylene and Benzene.
