State electricity company PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) in West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) is developing General Electricity Provider Stations (SPLU) in several locations in NTB, including Gili Trawangan in North Lombok and Mandalika Special Economic Zone (KEK) in Central Lombok.

PLN NTB general manager Mukhtar said the SPLU development is part of NTB provincial administration's commitment in developing eco-friendly tourism.

> “SPLU can now be used to fuel electric vehicles,” said Mukhtar.

There is one SPLU available in Gili Trawangan, which is home to many owners of electric motorcycles. Mukhtar mentioned that the addition of SPLU units in Gili Trawangan and KEK Mandalika would be done gradually.

> “We will coordinate with the provincial administration and Indonesia Tourism Development Corporation ITDC regarding location and permit,” he said.

PLN NTB aims to implement 30 SPLU units in 2018, which will be installed in several places, including six units in Mandalika and five units in West Lombok, North Lombok and East Lombok.

Sumbawa, Dompu and Bima regencies as well as Bima city are said to get two units each, meanwhile West Sumbawa regency will have one.

NTB currently has 10 SPLU units; two of them are located in Sangkareang Field and Udayana and one unit each in Islamic Centre NTB, Gili Trawangan and Ampenan Beach. (kes)
