Peroba is a common tree in Brazil, local craftsmen use its wood for everything. From the strong, straight-grained stock that resembles oak, they build entire houses using it for framing, paneling, millwork, moldings, flooring, and furniture.

It is also called [Aspidosperma polyneuron]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspidosperma_polyneuron)) is a timber tree native to Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, and Paraguay. It is common in Atlantic Forest vegetation. It is useful also for beekeeping.

They can send samples. Their strong point is that they are located exactly where the demolition of the old wooden houses is done, in the south of the Brasil and we have great quantity.
