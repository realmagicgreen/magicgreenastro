**The future of the world’s forests is very important to the planet, to animals, to businesses, to all of us.**

That’s why FSC certification exists. Whether you’re a forest manager, product manufacturer, retailer, or any number of other kinds of company, you can apply for FSC certification.

Being FSC certified means that your forest, or supply chain, is managed responsibly; that you comply with our environmental, social, and economic standards. This covers much more than the trees themselves, among other things, it makes sure that local communities are respected, protects the habitats of endangered plant and animal species, and ensures workers are properly paid.

When you become certified, your product can carry an [FSC label](https://ic.fsc.org/en/for-business/business-benefits/fsc-labels). It is a trusted symbol that shows consumers and businesses that you are sustainably managing either your forest, by preserving it for future generations, or supply chain operations. It is public recognition of your responsibility.

### Why should you choose FSC certification?

We are not the only forest management system, but our certification is credible, which, in turn, helps protect your brand and reputation. More and more organizations and governments specify FSC-certified materials must be used in procurement processes.

Meanwhile, WWF even recommends FSC certification to consumers, forest managers, and businesses. Why? Because FSC is trusted not just by NGOs. FSC certification is the most widely adopted framework among Fortune 500 companies.

Aside from showing the world your commitment to responsible forestry, FSC certification has other [business benefits](https://ic.fsc.org/en/benefits-for-business): it’s been proven that many businesses can receive financial benefits from being FSC certified (according to this [WWF cost-benefit report](http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?250330)).

### There are two types of FSC certification

[FSC forest management certification](https://ic.fsc.org/en/for-business/business-benefits/forest-management-certification) is awarded for responsible management of a forest or plantation area.

Wood, and other tree-based products, sourced from forests can undergo many processes before they become a product, so FSC chain of custody certification tracks FSC-certified material from forest to store.

### What's the certification cost?

The individual certification bodies that carry out assessments on behalf of FSC each determine their own fees. There is also an [annual administration fee (AAF)](https://ic.fsc.org/en/document-center/id/308) that you’ll pay through your certification body as part of your annual FSC certification audit.

The AAF was established to support the core FSC functions and services provided to certificate holders. The fee you pay is dependent on the type of certification you hold, the size, and type, of your forest area or site, and your annual turnover.


### Trademark licensing: an alternative to certification

If you’re a retailer, media organization, or educational institution, for example, you might not want or need to become certified, but may still want to promote FSC-labelled products or FSC certification as a framework. For these situations, FSC offer [trademark licensing](https://ic.fsc.org/en/for-business/how-to-use-fsc-trademarks).
