Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth. These forms of life include microorganisms, fungi, plants, and animals, including the communities that they form and the habitats in which they live.

According to the Convention on Biological Diversity, biodiversity is “the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems."

Biodiversity provides us with air, water, food and materials for medicine, clothing and shelter. Millions of people rely on biodiversity for livelihood and a host of ecosystem services. However, due to the continuous growth of population and overexploitation of biological resources, this “web of life” is now under serious threat.
