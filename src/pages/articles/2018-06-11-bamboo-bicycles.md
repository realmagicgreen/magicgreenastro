The crazy idea of making bikes out of bamboo is actually not all that crazy. It has excellent vibration dampening effects, noticeable on bumpy roads. And producing them means almost zero greenhouse gases emissions.

Bamboo is a very strong material which grows fast naturally. It has properties comparable to steel. It's an earthquake resistant construction material used to build bridges. Go figure.

East Bali bamboo bikes is a social enterprise and makes everything locally. They source all bamboo from local communities who harvest according to diameters, lengths and wall thicknesses we have specified.

East Bali bamboo bikes project started in 1998.  Then 19 isolated mountain hamlets of Desa Ban were living in absolute poverty without water, sanitation, roads, schools, health facilities or electricity.

They asked [East Bali Poverty Project](https://www.eastbalipovertyproject.org/) to help by educating  children so to lead to a better future with growth and prosperity.

Since 1999, EBPP have educated more than 1,500 children in 6 remote community schools. They are taught academic subjects and bamboo clump management. These craft skills empower them to create sustainable bamboo businesses.
