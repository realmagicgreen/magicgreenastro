Founded and conceived by John and Cynthia Hardy in 2006, Green School opened in 2008 with 90 students and a tailor-made campus that emerged from the jungle and rice fields. Since then it has grown to approximately 400 students.

It uses some renewable energy sources, including micro-hydro power from a "hydroelectric vortex", and solar power.

The campus is designed around the principles of an organic permaculture system, and the students cultivate an organic garden as part of their learning activities.

Buildings are constructed primarily from renewable resources including bamboo, local grass and traditional mud walls. The campus is an example of the large-scale building potential of bamboo architecture.

It offer a Bio Bus service, three 18-seater buses that run purely on biodiesel made from used cooking oil.
