There is a relationship between available bandwidth and economic health.

Worldwide broadband speed league 2018 has organized a study based on over 163 million speed tests in 200 countries.

In 2028 the world has an average of 9.1 Mbps of download speed.

The data was collected for the second year in a row across the 12 months up to 29 May this year by M-Lab, a partnership between New America's Open Technology Institute, Google Open Source Research, Princeton University's PlanetLab and other supporting partners, and compiled by Cable.

Thailand score at 40th place with and average of 17 Mbps download speed and is among the fastest in South East Asia.

Malaysia at 13 Mbps, South Korea at 20 Mbps, Vietnam at 6 Mbps, Sri Lanka, Philippine and Indonesia at 5 Mbps, Laos, Myanmar, at Brunei 4 Mbps.


After Singapore in the lead at 60.39 Mbps, the top countries for speed are all European:<br>
- Singapore (60.39 Mbps)<br>
- Sweden (46.00 Mbps)<br>
- Denmark (43.99 Mbps)<br>
- Norway (40.12 Mbps)<br>
- Romania (38.60 Mbps)<br>
- Belgium (36.71 Mbps)<br>
- Netherlands (35.95 Mbps)<br>

Further down comes:<br>
- Japan (28.94 Mbps)<br>
- Hong Kong (26.45 Mbps)<br>
- United States (25.86 Mbps)<br>
- Germany (24 Mbps)<br>
- New Zealand (24 Mbps)<br>


>“Europe, the US and thriving economic centers in the Asia-Pacific region – Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong – are leading the world when it comes to the provision of fast, reliable broadband, which suggests a relationship between available bandwidth and economic health. Those countries leading the world should be congratulated, but we should also be conscious of those that are being left further and further behind.” _Dan Howdle, consumer telecoms analyst at Cable_


It’s been very interesting looking at the data for a second year running, not least because we have three times as much of it this time around.

It is, however, somewhat sad to see the UK not faring better.

A number of other countries have leapfrogged us since last year, including France and Madagascar.

Compared to many other countries both in and out of Europe, the UK has simply come too late to a full fibre solution, relying instead on copper to cover the last mile.

Despite plans to roll out full fibre to UK homes across the next decade or so, the UK is likely to fall even further behind while they wait.
